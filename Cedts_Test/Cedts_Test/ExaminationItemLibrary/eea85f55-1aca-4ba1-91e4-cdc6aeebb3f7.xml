	(_1_) Employers should realise it is important to keep older workers in the workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_2_) A recent study found that most old people in some European countries had regular weekly contact with their adult children.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_3_) Few governments in rich countries have launched bold reforms to tackle the problem of population ageing.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_4_) In a report published some 20 years ago, the sustainability of old-age pension systems in most countries was called into doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_5_) Countries that have a shortage of young adults will be less willing to send them to war.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_6_) One-child families are more common in ageing societies due to the stress of urban life and the difficulties of balancing families and career.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_7_) A series of books, mostly authored by Americans, warned of confilicts between the older and younger generations.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_8_) Compared with younger ones, older societies tend to be less innovative and take fewer risks.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_9_) The best solution to the pension crisis is to postpone the retirement age.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_10_) Immigration as a means to boost the shrinking labour force may meet with resistance in some rich countries.&lt;br /&gt;
	Into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;unknown&lt;br /&gt;
	A) Until the early 1900s nobodu thought much about the whole populations getting older. UN had the foresignt to convene a &amp;quot;world assembly on ageing&amp;quot; back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled &amp;quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&amp;quot;, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;
	B)&amp;nbsp;For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, surrounded by the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.&lt;br /&gt;
	C) Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue reguar reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits, The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including the newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
	D) Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another quesion. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.&lt;br /&gt;
	E) The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the&amp;nbsp;opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time.&amp;nbsp;It may even keep them&amp;nbsp;alive longer. John Rother, the AARP&amp;#39;s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.&lt;br /&gt;
	F) Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may to because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour forece, increasing employers&amp;#39; choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.&lt;br /&gt;
	G)&amp;nbsp;In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;
	H) On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in the need of jobs, many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in&amp;nbsp;western&amp;nbsp;Europe&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;youthful&amp;nbsp;countries,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;times&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;ones.&amp;nbsp;Japan would&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;few&amp;nbsp;immigrants&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;present.&amp;nbsp;Public opinion polls&amp;nbsp;show&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;rich&amp;nbsp;countries already&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;immigration&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;too high. Further&amp;nbsp;big&amp;nbsp;increases&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;unfeasible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	I) To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.&lt;br /&gt;
	J)&amp;nbsp;And&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;fertility&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;pick&amp;nbsp;up?&amp;nbsp;It&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50-and older people turn out to vote in much greater numbers than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
	K)&amp;nbsp;Nor is&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;sign&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;intergenerational&amp;nbsp;warfare&amp;nbsp;predicted&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;1990s.&amp;nbsp;After&amp;nbsp;all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten&amp;nbsp;Hank&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Mannheim&amp;nbsp;University found&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;85%&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;lived&amp;nbsp;within&amp;nbsp;25km&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;each&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;majority&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them were&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;touch&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;least&amp;nbsp;once&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	L)&amp;nbsp;Even&amp;nbsp;so,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shift&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;centre&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;gravity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;age&amp;nbsp;groups&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;bound&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;a profound&amp;nbsp;effect&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;societies, not&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;economically&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;sorts of&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;ways&amp;nbsp;too. Richard Jackson and Neil&amp;nbsp;Howe&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;CSIS, in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;thoughtful book&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Graying&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great&amp;nbsp;Powers, argue&amp;nbsp;that, among&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.&lt;br /&gt;
	M)&amp;nbsp;For&amp;nbsp;example,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shortage&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;young&amp;nbsp;adults&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;likely&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world&amp;#39;s defence effort. Because America&amp;#39;s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically.&lt;br /&gt;
	N)&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;little&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;stop&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing,&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;to live&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;consequences&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;alleviated.&amp;nbsp;Many&amp;nbsp;experts&amp;nbsp;now believe that given the right policies, the&amp;nbsp;effects, though&amp;nbsp;grave, need&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be catastrophic. Most&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;recognised&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;something&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;are beginning&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	O)&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;even&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;guarantee&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;efforts&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. The director of Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: &amp;quot;We&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t really&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;what&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;like,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;nobody&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
