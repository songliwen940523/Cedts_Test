        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Rushmoore National Monument&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The well-known Rushmoore National Monument in the United States is erected （使竖立） on the Rushmoore Peak, 1829 meters above sea level, of the Black Hills in the south — west of South Dakota. It is a group of huge stone statues of four American presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Licoln and Theodore Roosevelt. President Washington is the founding father of the country; the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U．S．Declaration of Independence; the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation （独立宣言） and the 26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All the four presidents made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U.S. history.&lt;br/&gt;        The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota, with a view to carrying forward the U.S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The famed artist Gutzon Borglum, a naturalized Danish-American, made the design and was in charge of the project of historic significance. It was the 30th President Calvin Coolidge who announced in 1927 the start of the stone work. But before the work done, the sculptor passed away when he was 73 years of age. He was then succeeded by his son, and it was not until 1941 that the National Monument was put up.&lt;br/&gt;        As the stone statues were rather enormous, technology of directional blasting was resorted to in the main. Explosives were used to blow up the peak into models first, and then the stonemasons carved them into statues with tools. The broken stones weighed about four hundred fifty thousand tons in total. This project was the fruit of arduous （辛勤的） work done by a contingent of 360 odd masons （石工） in as long as 14 years. A sum of one million dollar was expended.&lt;br/&gt;        The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world, taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20 sq mt, with a 20-meter long face, a 7-meter long nose, a 2.6-meter wide mouth and two 1.5-meter wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction, they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. &lt;br/&gt;        Since the stone sculpture is unique in style, the Monument is now the U．S．National Art Centre of Popular Education. Groups of people keep streaming everyday to the site for a visit and tourists across the world are also interested in taking a view of this colossal （庞大的） Monument.</Content>

        <Script>M: Could I have your advice?
W: What about, David?
M: Well, I've put off doing my science requirement for three years.
W: And if you want to graduate this year, you've got to take a science course.
M: Right. I suppose since you are doing pre-medical, you know about the different courses.
W: Well, I have to take biology, chemistry, maths and physics. What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.
M: Yeah, I'm really weak in math. I did poorly in it in high school.
W: Then you'd better avoid chemistry and physics. How about astronomy? Everybody says Dr. Hanson is great. I'd take that course myself if I had the time.
M: That's what I thought I'd take. But it meets at the same time with my modern music course.
W: Geology is pretty interesting, then.
M: That's a good idea. It even fits in with my hobby of mountain climbing. Thanks a lot!</Script>

M: It's pizza. I just followed an old family recipe here, and . . .
W: Let me see that . . . Oh, Dad.
M: What?
W: You're missing a page!
M: Oh, uh, well, I couldn't find the second page of the recipe, but don't worry. I have plenty of experience around the house. Plenty of experience cooking.
W: That's not what mom says.
M: Well, wait, wait, here let me try a piece first. Here, let me, let me cool this off here. Ohhh, yeah. Oh, this is great stuff.
W: Yeah right. Why are you making that face?
M: Well, well, it's just, just a little rich for me. That's all.
W: Let me try it Dad. Uh. Dad. You put a little too much salt in it and besides it's burned. And what's that?
M: Oh, well, well, that's just part of my own adaptation to the recipe. I added some pumpkin.
W: Oh, not another one of your surprises. Pumpkin doesn't go on pizza!
M: Well, okay, well, so what? Uh, what do we do now?
W: Well, how about some cold cereal . . . You can't mess up on that, Dad.</Script>

        <Script>“Google”, the popular Internet search engine, offers a page called “Google News”, a summary of what is going on in a world inhabited entirely by computers.
   Clearly, the day is approaching when editors can be replaced by computers. This requires some urgent rethinking.
   Throughout the revolution of technology and globalization that has been going on for two decades, many believe that progress is a good thing. Some people are unfortunately caught in the wheels of change, but society as a whole benefits.
   We must distinguish, however, between making an exception and being worried about deeply troubling developments. It is one thing to sacrifice textile workers for progress. It is quite another to start throwing reporters into the flames of progress. It's very different.
   You see, journalists are responsible for reporting and analyzing the important issues of the day. In the prestige ranking of important issues, a key factor is how much an issue actually touches anyone's daily life.
   What happens when all the human editors have been eliminated? We know the answer from the movie "2001". In the movie a computer took over a space station and killed all the inhabitants. We will wake up one day to find that all the news is about the narrow-minded concerns of computers while important human developments get ignored.
   No doubt there are writers and policy analysts of all sorts who think today "They are going after editors, but I can never be replaced by a machine." Ladies and gentleman, that's what the editor thought.</Script>

        </Questions>
        <Script>Each university and college in the United States has different requirements for gaining admission to their MBA programs. There are also several different types of MBA programs available. Here is a brief outline of the different types of MBAs offered:
&lt;B&gt;1. Full-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The full-time MBA offers core courses that span all management disciplines. Students can also select from a variety of optional courses. The program usually takes between 18 and 24 months to complete. Students must attend classes at the business school on most weekdays. 
&lt;B&gt;2. Part-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The part-time MBA offers core courses and optional courses similar to the full-time program. Some schools allow students up to 7 years to complete their study, though the majority of part-time students will complete the program in 2 or 3 years. The part-time program usually appeals to students who are currently working, so classes are held at night and/or on the weekends. 
&lt;B&gt;3. On-Line MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The on-line program offers a core of general courses with a limited number of optional courses. The programs can take up to 8 years to complete, though students generally finish in 3 or 4 years. Coursework uses e-mail, computer conferencing, chat rooms, on-line bulletin boards, and sound and video clips. It is very important to make sure the program is recognized so hiring companies will consider it valid. 
&lt;B&gt;4. Executive MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The executive MBA, or EMBA, is generally designed for senior managers with at least 10 years of business experience. The courses tend to focus on global business issues and strategies. The program is very structured, with courses offered in sequence and students moving as one through the various steps. The program is generally considered full-time and can take up to 24 months to complete. Usually classes are held on the weekends and the work requires group projects and meetings. The EMBA is considered very prestigious; ranking and reputation of the school definitely matter.</Script>

        <Script>The convenience and economy of small cars account for their popularity. They are easy to park quickly and take smaller parking spaces. Small cars are also a means of conserving energy because they use less gas than big cars. Small cars are inconvenient and uncomfortable on long trips. However, because of their limited passenger and trunk space, they are also more economical to operate and maintain. And they cost less. Because of all these advantages, the next car I buy is going to be an Econo-Midget.</Script>

        <Content>        The man who, legend has it, escaped from an early grave when his uncle pulled him from drowning in a dirty pond is notorious for his dirty deeds but what cannot be forgotten are his achievements in the 1986 World Cup. The man is Maradona.&lt;br/&gt;        Forget the handball against England, feel the quality of his 50-yard solo goal in the same game and the near repeat performance in the semi-final against Belgium. The Argentina side of 1986 was functional and hard-working but it was Maradona who fired them to the final and then set up two of the goals in their 3-2 win over West Germany in the final.&lt;br/&gt;        In 1990, a barely-fit Maradona fought his way to the final where the Germans took their revenge. Few people shared Diego’s post-match tears. In fact many rejoiced that such an ugly brute of a team had lost.&lt;br/&gt;        Eight years before, in Spain, Maradona, then newly arrived at Barcelona, disgraced himself by being sent off in a Second Phase game with Brazil. Even four years before that the 18-year-old Maradona was a source of great controversy when he was left out of the victorious squad that won on home ground.&lt;br/&gt;        USA 1994 was the end for Maradona as a player. Right after the Nigeria game, he was picked for drugs-screening and tested positive for banned stimulant ephedrine (麻黄硷). He was banned from the rest of the tournament and the team fell apart, going out in the second round to Romania.</Content>

        <Content>        At one point along an open highway, I came to a crossroads with a traffic light. I was alone on the road by now, but as I approached the light, it turned red, and I braked to a halt. I looked left, right, and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of headlights, but there I sat, waiting for the light to change, the only human being for at least a mile in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;        I started wondering why I refused to run the light. I was not afraid of being arrested, because there was obviously no cop anywhere around and there certainly would have been no danger in going through it.&lt;br/&gt;        Much later that night, after I'd met with a group in Lewisburg and had climbed into bed near midnight, the question of why I'd stopped for that light came back to me. I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the law, but it's an agreement we have, and we trust each other to honor it: We don't go through red lights. Like most of us, I'm more apt to be restrained from doing something bad by the social convention that disapproves of it than by any law against it.&lt;br/&gt;        It's amazing that we ever trust each other to do the right thing, isn't it? And we do, too. Trust is our first inclination. We have to make a deliberate decision to mistrust someone or to be suspicious or skeptical.</Content>
