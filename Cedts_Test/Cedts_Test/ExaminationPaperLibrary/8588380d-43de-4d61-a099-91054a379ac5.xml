W: Yes!
M: So how high is this amazing waterfall? 
W: Uh, I don't really know. It's really big. 
M: Really? So is it famous because it's really tall or because it's really wide?
W: Could be both. 
M: Oh, really, that's a big waterfall. OK. When is the last time you went home?
W: Last week. 
M: Uh-huh. Really! Both of your parents still live there?
W: Yes.
M: OK. And were your parents born there?
W: Yes, but different towns. My father is from Yashima, the same hometown, the same home as my home, but my mom is from Nigaho, a next town from Yashima. 
M: Oh, ok. Do you have a lot of childhood memories? 
W: Yes, uh, actually but my dad was really busy, so my mom took me to many places when I was a child.
M: Oh, that's sweet.</Script>

        <Script>In many English houses people eat four meals a day: breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. Breakfast takes place at any time from 7 to 9. It consists of porridge, bacon, eggs, toast of bread and butter with marmalade. English people drink tea or coffee at breakfast.
Lunch comes at one o'clock. It can range from a ham sandwich to a three-course meal. Afternoon tea is between 4 and 5 and dinner is about half past seven. The first course is soup. The next course generally consists of meat or fish with vegetables. Then comes some sort of dessert, either pudding or fruit of various kinds: apples, pears, bananas, etc. But not all English people eat like that. Some of them have their dinner in the middle of the day. Their meals are breakfast, dinner, tea and supper and all these meals are very simple.</Script>

        <Script>Two years ago my husband bought me a bicycle. If you live in a town, it is often faster than a car and you don't have to worry about parking. You can leave it anywhere. As it has a seat at the back and a basket at the front, I can take my daughter to school, to the library, shopping, anywhere in fact.
I use it most in summer when the weather is warm and dry. It can be very unpleasant in winter when it is cold and the rain is pouring down. It can also be very dangerous. You must of course be careful on a bicycle. Accidents are not the only problem, though. One day I went shopping and came back to find my front wheel was missing. It was a long walk to the bicycle shop! Now I have three strong locks.
My husband uses my bicycle sometimes for short journeys. He is not a good cyclist but says it is better than waiting for a bus. He still prefers his car for longer journeys, but I think that all this sitting down is making him fat and lazy. On my bicycle I get a lot of exercise and fresh air, and cycling makes me feel a lot younger.</Script>

        <Script>Americans eat breakfast and lunch quickly unless it is a social, business or family occasion. The evening meal is usually longer and a time for families to gather together. Rushing through daytime meals is part of the fast pace in America. Another reason for rushing through daytime meals is that many people eat in restaurants that are usually crowded with people waiting for a place so that they too can be served and return to work at the proper time. So each one hurries to make room for the next person. As with busy people everywhere, there is a real difference with meals that are eaten in a hurry and those that can be enjoyed slowly with friends.</Script>

        <Content>        Praise is like sunlight to the human spirit; we cannot flower and (_1_) without it. And yet, while most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold wind of (_2_), we are somehow reluctant to give our fellows the warm (_3_) of praise.&lt;br/&gt;        Why — when one word can bring such pleasure? A friend of mine who travels (_4_) always tries to learn a little of the language of any place she (_5_). She's not much of a linguist, but she does know how to say one word — "beautiful" — in several (_6_). She can use it to a mother holding her baby, or to a lonely salesman fishing out pictures of his family. The ability has (_7_) her friends all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;        It's strange how we are (_8_) about praising. Perhaps it's because few of us know how to accept (_9_) gracefully. Instead, we are embarrassed and shrug off the words we are really so glad to hear. Because of this (_10_) reaction, direct compliments are surprisingly difficult to give. That is why some of the most valued pats are those which come to us indirectly, in a letter or passed on by a friend.</Content>

        <Content>        What is your favorite color? Do you like yellow, orange, red? If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grays and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy, and you would rather follow than lead. You tend to be a pessimist. At least, this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference, as well as the effect that colors have on human beings. They tell us among other facts, that we do not choose our favorite color as we grow up — we are born with our preference. If you happen to love brown, you did so, as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly.&lt;br/&gt;        Colors do influence our moods — there is no doubt about it. A yellow room makes most people feel more cheerful and more relaxed than a dark green one; and a red dress brings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing. A black bridge over the Thames River, near London, used to be the scene of more suicides than any other bridge in the area — until it was repainted green. The number of suicide attempts immediately fell sharply; perhaps it would have fallen even more if the bridge had been done in pink or baby blue.&lt;br/&gt;        Light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. It is an established fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or grey.</Content>

        <Content>        The concept of personal choice in relation to health behaviors is an important one. An estimated 90 percent of all illnesses may be preventable if individuals would make sound personal health choices based upon current medical knowledge. We all enjoy our freedom of choice and do not like to see it restricted when it is within the legal and moral boundaries of society. The structure of American society allows us to make almost all our own personal decisions that may concern our health. If we desire, we can smoke, drink excessively, refuse to wear seat belts, eat whatever foods we want, and &lt;i&gt;live a completely sedentary life-style&lt;/i&gt; without any exercise. The freedom to make such personal decisions is a fundamental aspect of our society, although the wisdom of these decisions can be questioned. Personal choices relative to health often cause a difficulty. As one example, a teenager may know the facts relative to smoking cigarettes and health but may be pressured by friends into believing it is the socially accepted thing to do.&lt;br/&gt;        A multitude of factors, both inherited and environmental, influence the development of health-related behaviors, and it is beyond the scope of this text to discuss all these factors as they may affect any given individual. However, the decision to adopt a particular health-related behavior is usually one of personal choice. There are healthy choices and there are unhealthy choices. In discussing the morals of personal choice, Fries and Crapo drew a comparison. They suggest that to knowingly give oneself over to a behavior that has a statistical probability of shortening life is similar to attempting suicide. Thus, for those individuals who are interested in preserving both the quality and quantity of life, personal health choices should reflect those behaviors that are associated with a statistical probability of increased vitality and longevity.</Content>
