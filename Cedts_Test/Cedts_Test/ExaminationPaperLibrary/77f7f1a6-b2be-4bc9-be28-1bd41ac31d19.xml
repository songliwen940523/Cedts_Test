        <Script>Now I'd like to talk to you about the final exam. The exam will be held next Thursday, the last day of exam week. Remember to bring along two or three pens in case you run out of ink. Unlike the mid-term this test will not include multiple choice questions. It will consist entirely of essays. You'll have to answer three of the five essay questions. The exam will be comprehensive, which means you will be responsible for all of the subject material we've covered in class. I would suggest you review your mid-term's as well as the textbook and your class notes. The final will count for 50% of your grade in the course; the research project will count for 20% percent; and the mid-term 30%. I'll be in my office almost all day on Tuesday of next week. If you run into any problems, please feel free to stop in. Good luck with your studying and I'll see you on Thursday.</Script>

        <Content>        On this day in 1978, Toni Morrison wins the National Book Critics Circle Award for "Song of Solomon". The award brought the writer national (_1_) for the first time, although she had already published two moderately (_2_) books, "The Bluest Eye" (1969) and "Sula" (1973). Morrison went on to win the Pulitzer in 1988 and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993.&lt;br/&gt;        Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in the steel town of Lorain, Ohio, to a welder（焊接工） father and (_3_) mother. She graduated from Howard University in 1953, then took a master's in literature at Cornell. She (_4_) architect Howard Morrison and had two sons. After she and her husband divorced, Morrison taught English and worked as one of the very few black editors at Random House. She (_5_) her first novel in 1969. After the publication of her (_6_) novel in 1978, she published "Tar Baby" (1981) and "Jazz" (1992). Her 1987 novel, "Beloved", the story of a 19th-century slave who escapes bondage but is forced to kill her own baby, won the Pulitzer.&lt;br/&gt;        When Morrison won the Nobel Prize in 1993, she (_7_) the first African-American to win the award, as well as the first American (_8_) to win in more than 50 years. The same year, a fire destroyed her Nyack, New York, home. (_9_), she'd left the manuscript of her next novel, "Paradise", in her office at Princeton University, where she was teaching (_10_) writing. The book, published in 1998, explored the dynamics（变迁发展史） of an all-black town in the late 1960s.</Content>

        <Content>        The early settlers who came from the eastern United States were used to having lots of trees around. They found it hard to adapt to a treeless place like Nebraska and they needed trees for building and for fuel. So they started many tree-planting programs that went on for years and years. Finally, in 1872 a newspaperman named J. Sterling Morton had an idea. Why not have a special day set aside for planting trees? So Arbor Day was born, and on April 10, 1872, the first Arbor Day was celebrated. The state government announced that it would give prizes to individuals and groups who planted the most trees. In that first day, more than one million trees were planted in Nebraska.</Content>

        <Content>        The African elephant, the largest land animal now alive, is in danger of extinction (灭绝). The reasons are very similar to those in other cases of near-extinction: the beast is the source of a highly valued commodity -- in this case, ivory -- and the animal's habitat (居住地) is being more and more fenced in by human settlements. East African elephants are most immediately threatened because they are victims of an illegal trade in ivory. At the same time, a growing human population has forced all African elephants back into once remote parks, where elephant density has in many cases exceeded the natural food supply.</Content>

        <Content>        The obvious disagreements between England and America began in 1763, more than a century and a half after the first permanent settlement had been founded at Jamestown, Virginia. The colonies had grown vastly in economic strength and cultural attainment and virtually all had long years of self-government behind them. Their combined population now exceeded 1,500,000 --- a sixfold (六倍的) increase since 1700.&lt;br/&gt;        To tighten its control over America, the British imposed heavy duties on American people. When the "Stamp Act" was issued, which provided that revenue stamps be affixed (粘贴) to all newspapers, broadsides, pamphlets, licenses, leases, or other legal documents, organized resistance started to appear.&lt;br/&gt;        On March 5, 1770, 18 months after the British sent troop to Boston, hatred between citizens and soldiery became stronger than ever before. What began as a harmless snowballing of the redcoats degenerated (恶化) into a mob attack. Someone gave the order to fire, three Bostonians lay dead in the snow.&lt;br/&gt;        At the suggestion of the Virginia Congress, colonial representatives were called on to meet in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, "to consult upon the present unhappy state of the Colonies." Delegates (代表) to this meeting, known as the first Continental Congress, were chosen by provincial congresses or popular conventions. Every colony except Georgia sent at least one delegate, and the total number of 55 was large enough for diversity of opinion but small enough for genuine debate and effective action.</Content>

        <Content>        Clair Miller and his crew picked up a new B-24 at California's March Field on Christmas Eve, 1943, and prepared to fly to England. But they decided to have "one more hamburger" before heading out for the distant land of fish and chips.&lt;br/&gt;        As the airmen sat in a local restaurant, a beautiful young waitress approached. "I understand you're going to England," she said to Miller. Then she told him that her fiancé (未婚夫), an aviation gunner (射击手) like Miller, was stationed there.&lt;br/&gt;        The woman said she was waiting for him to provide an address so she could send him a picture of herself. "You might run into him," she told Miller hopefully. "Would you take it?"&lt;br/&gt;        Miller knew it was unlikely he'd ever see her fiancé. But he didn't want to disappoint the woman. He took the picture and placed it in his wallet. Later he realized he hadn't even asked the man's name. Then it was on to Europe and the war.&lt;br/&gt;        On August 9, 1944, Miller's plane was shot down, and he was forced to parachute (跳伞) to an island off the coast of Holland. Captured by the Nazis (纳粹), he spent the next nine months as a prisoner of war.&lt;br/&gt;        It was on Christmas Eve that someone told him a 19-year-old American prisoner down the hall was badly depressed. Miller decided to pay the man a visit.&lt;br/&gt;        The two began to exchange details about their families. "Was he married?" the kid asked. "Yeah, since 1938," responded Miller.&lt;br/&gt;        "Have you got her picture?" the soldier asked. So Miller reached for his wallet, and pulled out a photograph of his wife.&lt;br/&gt;        "She's beautiful!" the young man responded. Then he noticed that a second picture had fallen out, and an expression of wonder crossed his face. "Where did you get that?" Miller told the story of the waitress at the California hamburger stand.&lt;br/&gt;        "That's my fiancée," the puzzled man said. Miller kept his promise to the beautiful girl back home and turned the picture over to its rightful (合法的) owner.</Content>
