        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Media Selection for Advertisements&lt;br/&gt;	After determining the target audience for a product or service, advertising agencies must select the appropriate media for the advertisement. We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home. Internet, and direct mail.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Television&lt;br/&gt;	Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication.But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Television&amp;#39;s influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance.&lt;br/&gt;	is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(具有共同特点的) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers. This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Newspaper?&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual ad revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually, ii m increased its national circulation (发行量) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in ion ciues. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer. more detailed message to their audience than they can through 48 hours,meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out.Newspapers are ofen the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local reader.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Radio&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Advertising on radio continues to grow Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor bill-boards (广告牌) and ihe Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeal their ads often. Internet companies are also turning 10 radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day.Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Two major changes&amp;mdash;satellite and Internet radio&amp;mdash;will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the&lt;br/&gt;	local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Magazines&lt;br/&gt;	Newsweeklies, women&amp;rsquo;s titles, and business magazines have all seen increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market, magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television attracts all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous, if you read sports illustrated, for example, you have much in common with the magazine&amp;rsquo;s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Advertiser using the print media-magazines and newspapers-will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers, these second. Advertisers will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;	Out-of-home advertising&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Out-of-home advertising. Also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly effective way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for advertising is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective, technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past.&lt;br/&gt;	Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they.&lt;br/&gt;	Can change their messages more quickly.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Internet&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease. The challenge to Internet advertisers Is to create ads that audience members remember.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations&amp;#39; advertising in the near ftuture. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Direct mail&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client&amp;#39;s message Direct mail includes newsletters. postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers.For many businesses.direct mail is the most effective from of advertising.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	Conversation One&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Gosh! Have you seen this, Richard?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Seen What?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: In the paper, it says there&amp;rsquo;s a man going round pretending he&amp;rsquo;s from the electricity board. He&amp;rsquo;s been calling at people&amp;rsquo;s homer, saying he&amp;rsquo;s come to check that all their appliances are safe. The he gets around them to make him a cup of tea and while they are out of the room, he steals their money, handbag, whatever and makes off with it.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: But you know Jane, it&amp;rsquo;s partly their own fault. You should never let anyone like that in unless you are expecting them.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: It&amp;rsquo;s all very well to say that, but someone comes to the door and says electricity or gas, and you automatically think they are OK, especially if they flash a card to you.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Does this man have an ID then?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s just it! It seems he used to work for the electricity board at one time. According to the paper, the police are warning people, especially pensioners not to admit anyone unless they have an appointment. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit sad. One old lady told them she&amp;rsquo;d just been to the post office to draw her pension when he called. She said he must have followed her home. He stole the whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: But what does he look like? Surely they must have a description.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, yes, they have. Let&amp;rsquo;s see. In his thirties, tall, bushy dark hair, slight northern accent, sounds a bit like you actually.&lt;/p&gt;

	Conversation Two&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Miss Jones, could you tell me more about first job with hotel marketing concepts?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, certainly. I was a marketing consultant, responsible for marketing ten UK hotels. They were all luxury hotels in the leisure sector, all of a very high standard.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Which markets were you responsible for?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: For Europe and Japan.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see from your resume that you speak Japanese. Have you ever been to Japan?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, I have. I spent a month in Japan in 2006. I met all the key people in the tourist industry, the big tour operators and tourist organizations. As I speak Japanese, I had a very big advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes, of course. Have you had any contact with Japan in your present job?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot. The truth is I have become very popular with the Japanese, both for holidays and for business conferences. In fact, the market for all types of luxury holidays for the Japanese has increased a lot recently.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Really, I&amp;rsquo;m interested to hear more about that, but first, tell me, have you ever traveled on a luxury train? The Orient Express, for example.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: No I haven&amp;rsquo;t, but I have traveled on a glacier express to Switzerland and I traveled China by train about 8 years ago. I love train travel. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in this job.&lt;/p&gt;

	Passage One&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Time! I think a lot about time. And not just because it&amp;rsquo;s the name of the news organization I work for. Like most working people, I find time or the lack of it a never ending frustration and an unwinnable battle. My everyday is a race against the clock that I never ever seem to win. This is hardly a lonesome complaint. According to the Families and Work Institute&amp;rsquo;s national study of the changing workforce, fifty-five percent of employees say they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for themselves, sixty-three percent don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for their spouses or partners, and sixty-seven percent don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time for their children. It&amp;rsquo;s also not a new complaint. I bet our ancestors returned home form hunting wild animals and gathering nuts and complained about how little time they had to pay in battle scenes on their cave wars. The difference is that the boss of animal-hunting and the head of nut-gathering probably told them to shut up or no survival for you. Today&amp;rsquo;s workers are still demanding control over their time. The difference is today&amp;rsquo;s bosses are listening. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a report issued today called &amp;ldquo;When Work Words&amp;rdquo; produced jointly by three organizations. They set out to find and award the employers who employ the most creative and most effective ways to give their workers flexibility. I found this report worth reading and suggest every boss should read it for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

	Passage Two&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Loving a child is a circular business. The more you give, the more you get, the more you want to give.&amp;rdquo; Penelope Leach once said. What she said proves to be true of my blooded family. I was born in 1931. As the youngest of six children , I learned to share my parents&amp;rsquo; love. Raising six children during the difficult times of the Great Depression took its toll its toll on my parent&amp;rsquo;s relationship and resulted in their divorce when I was 18 years old. Daddy never had very close relationships with his children and drifted even farther away form us after the divorce.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Several years later a wonderful woman came into his life, and they were married. She had two sons, one of them still at home. Under her influence, we became a &amp;ldquo;blended family&amp;rdquo; and a good relationship developed between the two families. She always treated us as if we were her own children. They shared over twenty-five year together before our father passed away. At the time of his death, the question came up of my mother-Daddy&amp;rsquo;s first wife&amp;mdash;attending his funeral. I will never forget the unconditional love shown by my stepmother when I asked her if she would object to Mother attending Daddy&amp;rsquo;s funeral. Without giving it a second thought, she immediately replied, &amp;ldquo;Of course not, Honey. She&amp;rsquo;s the mother of my children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

	Passage Three&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In February last year, my wife lost her job. Just as suddenly, the owner of the greenhouse where I worked as manager died at heart attack. His family announced that they were going to close the business because no one in the family wanted to run it. Things looked pretty gloomy. My wife and I read the want ads each day. Then one morning, as I was hanging out the &amp;ldquo;Going Out of Business&amp;rdquo; sign at the greenhouse, the door opened, and in walked a customer. She was an office manager whose company had just moved into the new office park on the edge of town. She was looking for pots and plants to place in the reception areas in the offices.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about plants,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sure in a few weeks they&amp;rsquo;ll all be dead.&amp;rdquo; While I was helping her select her purchases, my mind was racing. Perhaps as many as a dozen firms have recently opened offices in the new office park, and there were several hundred more acres with construction underway. That afternoon, I drove out to the office park. By six o&amp;rsquo;clock that evening, I had signed contracts with seven companies to rent plants from me and pay me a fee to maintain them. Within a week, I had worked out an agreement to lease the greenhouse from the owner&amp;rsquo;s family. Business is now increasing rapidly, and one day, we hope to be the proud owners of the greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

How would I, unable to speak the language, (_3_) unfamiliar with local geography or transportation systems, set up (_4_) and do research? It seemed impossible, and with considerable (_5_) I sat down to write a letter begging off. Halfway through, a thought ran through my mind: you can&amp;rsquo;t learn if you don&amp;rsquo;t try.

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the 21st century, but- regardless of whether it is or isn&amp;#39;t - we won&amp;#39;t do much about it. We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed. A1 Gore calls global warming an &amp;quot;inconvenient truth,&amp;quot; as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don&amp;#39;t know enough to relieve global warming, and - without major technological breakthroughs - we can&amp;#39;t do much about it. From 2003 to 2050,the world &amp;#39;s population is projevted to grow from&amp;nbsp; 6.4 billon to 9.1 billion ,a 42% increase.if energy use per person and&amp;nbsp; technology remain te same,total energy use and greenhouse gas&amp;nbsp; emissions(mainly,CO2)will be 42% higher in 2050.But that&amp;#39;s too&amp;nbsp; low,because societies that grow richer use more energy.We need econmic&amp;nbsp; growth unless we condemn the world&amp;#39;s poor to their present&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Poverty and freeze everyone else&amp;#39;s living standards.With modest&amp;nbsp; growth,energy use and greenhouse emissions more then double by 2050. No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and&amp;nbsp; personal freeom (limits on electricity usage,driving and travel)that&amp;nbsp; might cut back global warming.Still,politicians want to show they&amp;#39;re&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;doing something&amp;quot;Consider the Kyoto Protoco(京都议定书).It alowed&amp;nbsp; countries that joined to punish those that didn&amp;#39;t.But it hasn&amp;#39;t&amp;nbsp; reduced CO2 emissions(up about 25% since 1990),and many signatories(签 字国) didn&amp;#39;t adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012&amp;nbsp; targets. The practical codusion is that if global warming is a potential&amp;nbsp; disaster,the only solution is new technology.Only an aggressive&amp;nbsp; research and development program miaght find ways of breaking our&amp;nbsp; dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it. The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a&amp;nbsp; moral proble when it&amp;#39;s teally an engineering one.The inconvenient&amp;nbsp; truth is that if we don&amp;#39;t solve the engineering problem, we&amp;#39;re helpless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Someday a siranger will read your e-mail without your permission or scan the Website you&amp;#39;ve visited，Or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchases or cell phonebills to find out your shopping preferences or calling habits. In fact, it&amp;#39;s likely some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permisson? It might be a spous, a girlfreiend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen - the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked. Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, that it&amp;#39;s important to reveal yourself to friends, family and lovers in stages, at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain. The digital bread crumbs(碎屑) you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can reveal what you think. Like it or not, increasingly we live in a world where you simply cannot keep a secret. The key question is: Does that matter? For many Americans, the answer apparently is &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot; When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most say they are concerned about losting it. A survery found an overwhelming pessimism about privacy, with 60 percent of respondents saying they feel their privacy is &amp;quot;slipping away, and that bothers me.&amp;quot; But people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny fraction of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths(收费站) to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that can track automobile movements. And few turn donw supermarket loyalty cards. Privacy economist A lessandro Acauisti has run a series of&amp;nbsp; tests that reveal people will surrender personal information like Socail Security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cents-off coupon(优惠卷)。 But privacy does matter - at least sometimes. It&amp;#39;s like health: When you have it, you don&amp;#39;t notice it. Only when it&amp;#39;s gone do you wish you&amp;#39;d done more to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
