Built for horse, carriage, and foot traffic, they were usually poorly cared for and too narrow to accommodate (容纳) automobiles.&lt;br/&gt;	With the increase in auto production, private turnpike (收费公路) companies under local authorities began to spring up, and by 1921 there were 387,000 miles of paved roads. Many were built using specifications of 19th century Scottish engineers Thomas Telford and John MacAdam (for whom the macadam surface is named), whose specifications stressed the importance of adequate drainage. Beyond that, there were no national standards for size, weight restrictions, or commercial signs. During World War I, roads throughout the country were nearly destroyed by the weight of trucks. When General Eisenhower returned from Germany in 1919, after serving in the U.S. army&amp;rsquo;s first transcontinental motor convoy (车队), he noted: &amp;ldquo;The old convoy had started me thinking about good, two-lane highways, but Germany&amp;rsquo;s Autobahn or motorway had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons across the land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	It would take another war before the federal government would act on a national highway system. During World War II, a tremendous increase in trucks and new roads were required. The war demonstrated how critical highways were to the defense effort. Thirteen per cent of defense plants received all their supplies by truck, and almost all other plants shipped more than half of their products by vehicle. The war also revealed that local control of highways had led to a confusing variety of design standards. Even federal and state highways did not follow basic standards. Some states allowed trucks up to 36,000 pounds, while others restricted anything over 7,000 pounds.&lt;br/&gt;	A government study recommended a national highway system of 33,920 miles, and congress soon passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which called for strict, centrally controlled design criteria.&lt;br/&gt;	The interstate highway system was finally launched in 1956 and has been hailed as one of the greatest public works projects of the century. To build its 44,000-mile web of highways, bridge, and tunnels, hundreds of unique engineering designs and solutions had to be worked out. Consider the many geographic features of the country: mountains, steep grades, wetlands, rivers, deserts and plains. Variables included the slope of the land, the ability of the pavement to support the load, the intensity of road use, and the nature of the underlying soil. Urban areas were another problem. Innovative designs of roadways, tunnels, bridges, overpasses, and interchanges that could run through or bypass urban areas soon began to weave their way across the country, forever altering the face of America.&lt;br/&gt;	Today, the interstate system links every major city in the U.S., and the U.S. with Canada and Mexico. Built with safety in mind, the highways have wide lanes and shoulders, dividing medians, or barriers, long entry and exit lanes, curves engineered for safe turns, and limited access. The death rate on highways is half that of all other U.S. roads (0.86 deaths per 100 million passenger miles compared to 1.99 deaths per 100 million on all other roads).&lt;br/&gt;	By opening the North American continent, highways have enabled consumer goods and services to reach people in remote and rural areas of the country, spurred the growth of suburbs, and provided people with greater options in term of jobs, access to cultural programs, health care, and other benefits. Above all, the interstate system provides individuals with what they cherish most: personal freedom of mobility.&lt;br/&gt;	The interstate system has been an essential element of the nation&amp;rsquo;s economic growth in terms of shipping and job creation: more than 75 percent of the nation&amp;rsquo;s freight deliveries arrive by truck; and most products that arrive by rail or air use interstates for the last leg of the journey by vehicle. Not only has the highway system affected the American economy by providing shipping routes, it has led to the growth of spin-off industries like service stations, motels, restaurants, and shopping centers. It has allowed the relocation of manufacturing plants and other industries from urban areas to rural.&lt;br/&gt;	By the end of the century there was an immense network of paved roads, residential streets, expressways, and freeways built to support millions of vehicles. The highway system was officially renamed for Eisenhower to honor his vision and leadership. The year construction began he said: &amp;ldquo;Together, the united forces of our communication and transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we bear&amp;mdash;United States. Without them, we would be a mere alliance of many separate parts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	W: We are a small financial company trading mostly stocks and bonds may I ask why you are so interested in working for us?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Your company has an impressive reputation and I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to work for a smaller company.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: That&amp;rsquo;s good to hear. Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I&amp;rsquo;m currently working in a large international company in charge of a team of 8 brokers. We buy and sell stocks for major clients worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;

	M: Aha, if I were hired, how many accounts would I be handling?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: you will be working with two other head brokers, in another words, you will be handling about a third of our clients.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: And who would I report to?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Directly to me.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see. What kind of benefits package do you offer?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year employment, you are also been entitled to medical and dental insurance, but this is something you should discuss with our Personnel Department. Do you have any other questions?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: No not at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I have to discuss you application with my colleagues and we&amp;rsquo;ll get back to you early next week.&lt;br /&gt;

	Conversation 2&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Hey, Karen, you are not really reading it, are you?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Pardon?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: The book! You haven&amp;rsquo;t turned the page in the last ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: No, Jim, I suppose I haven&amp;rsquo;t. I need to get through it, though, but I keep drifting away.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really hold your interest?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: No, not really. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother with it, to be honest, but I have to read it for a seminar. I&amp;rsquo;m at a university.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: It&amp;rsquo;s a labor of labor then rather than a labor of love.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I should say, I don&amp;rsquo;t like Dickens at all really, the author, indeed, I am starting to like the whole course less and less.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: It&amp;rsquo;s not just the book,, it&amp;rsquo;s the curse as well?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yeah, in a way, although the curse itself isn&amp;rsquo;t really that bad, a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturer is fine, as to me, I suppose, you see, I want to do philosophy rather than English, but my parents took me out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: So the courses are OK as such, it&amp;rsquo;s just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, they had my best interest and heart of course, my parents, they always do, don&amp;rsquo;t they? They believe that my job prospect would be pretty limited with the degree of philosophy. Plus, they give me a really generous allowance, but I am beginning to feel that I&amp;rsquo;m wasting my time and their money. They would be so disappointed though if I told them I was quitting.&lt;/p&gt;

	Passage One&lt;br /&gt;
	In Greece, only rich people will rest in peace for ever when they die. Most of the population, however, will be undisturbed for only three years, then they will be dug up, washed, compressed into a small tin box, and placed in a bone room. If the body has only partially decayed, it is reburied in a smaller cheaper grave, but not for long, the body will be dug up again some time later when it has fully decayed. Buying a piece of land for a grave is the only way to avoid this process. The cost of the grave is so great that most p0eople choose to rent the grave for three years and even after it has been dug up, lasting peace is still not guaranteed. If no one pays for renting space in the bone room, the skeleton is removed and stored in a building in a poor part of the town. Lack of space in Athens is the main reason why the dead are dug up after the three years. The city is so overcrowded that sometimes dead bodies are kept in the hospitals for over a week until a grave is found. Athens&amp;rsquo; city council wants to introduce cremation, that is burning dead bodies as a means of dealing with the problems. But the Greek church resists this practice, they believe the only place where people burn is hell, so burning dead bodies is against the Greek concept of life after death. To save space, the church suggested burying the bodies standing up instead of lying down. Some people proposed building multi-storey underground grave yards.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage Two&lt;br /&gt;
	If you visit a big city anywhere in the world, you will probably find a restaurant would serve the food of your own native country. Most large cities in the United States offer international sample of foods. Many people enjoy eating the food of other nations. This is probably one reason why there are so many different kinds of restaurants in the United States. A second reason is that many Americans come from other part of the world. They enjoy tasting the foods of their native lands. In the city of Detroit, for example, there are many people from western Europe, Greece, Latin America, and the Far East. There are many restaurants in Detroit which serve the foods of these areas. There are many other international restaurants too. Americans enjoy the foods in these restaurants as well as the opportunity to better understand the people and their way of life. One of the most common international restaurants to be found in the United States is the Italian restaurant. The restaurant may be a small business run by a single family. The mother of the family cooks all of the dishes, and the father and children serve the people who come to eat there. Or it may be a large restaurant owned by several different people who worked together in the business. Many Italian dishes that Americans enjoy are made with meats, tomatoes and cheese, they are very delicious and tasty.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage Three&lt;br /&gt;
	One winter day in 1891, a class at a training school in Massachusetts, U.S.A, went into the gym for their daily exercises. Since the football season had ended, most of the young man felt they were in for a boring time.&lt;br /&gt;
	But their teacher, James Nasmith had other ideas. He had been working for a long time on a new game that would have the excitement of the American football. Nasmith showed the men a basket he had hung at the each end of the gym, and explained that they were going to sue a round European football, at first everybody tried to throw the ball into the basket no matter where he was standing. &amp;ldquo;Pass! Pass!&amp;rdquo; Nasmith kept shouting, blowing his whistle to stop the excited players. Slowly, they began to understand what was wanted of them. The problem with the new game, which was soon called &amp;ldquo;basketball&amp;rdquo;, was getting the ball out of the basket. They used ordinary food baskets with bottoms and the ball, of course, stayed inside. At first, someone had to climb up every time a basket was scored. It was several years before someone came up with the idea of removing the bottom of the basket and letting the ball fall through. There have been many changes in the rules since then, and basketball has become one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular sports.&lt;br /&gt;

	For Americans, time is money. They say, &amp;ldquo;you only get so much time in this life; you&amp;rsquo;d better use it wisely.&amp;rdquo; The (_1_) will not be better than the past or present, as American are&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_2_) to see things, unless people use their time for constructive activity.

	The American attitude toward time is not&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_8_)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;shared by others, especially non-Europeans. They are more likely to regard time as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_9_) . One of the more difficult things many students must adjust to in the states is the notion that time must be saved whenever possible and used wisely every day.In the contest&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_) , McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, KFC, and other fast food establishments are successful in a country where many people want to spend the least amount of time preparing and eating meals.

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Communications technologies are far from equal when it comes to conveying the truth. The first study to compare honesty across a range of communication media has fund that people are twice as likely to tell lies in phone conversations as they are in emails. The fact that emails are automatically recorded&amp;mdash;and can come back to haunt (困扰) you&amp;mdash;appears to be the key to the finding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Jeff Hancock of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, asked 30 students to keep a communications diary for a week. In it they noted the number of conversations or email exchanges they had lasting more than 10 minutes, and confessed to how many lies they told. Hancock then worked out the number of lies per conversation for each medium. He found that lies made up 14 per cent of emails, 21 per cent of instant messages, 27 per cent of face-to-face interactions and an astonishing 37 per cent of phone calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	His results to be presented at the conference on human-computer interaction in Vienna, Austria, in April, have surprised psychologists. Some expected emailers to be the biggest liars, reasoning that because deception makes people uncomfortable, the detachment (非直接接触) of emailing would make it easier to lie. Others expected people to lie more in face-to-face exchanges because we are most practised at that form of communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	But Hancock says it is also crucial whether a conversation is being recorded and could be reread, and whether it occurs in real time. People appear to be afraid to lie when they know the communication could later be used to hold them to account, he says. This is why fewer lies appear in email than on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	People are also more likely to lie in real time&amp;mdash;in a instant message or phone call, say&amp;mdash;than if they have time to think of a response, says Hancock. He found many lies are spontaneous (脱口而出的) responses to an unexpected demand, such as: &amp;ldquo;Do you like my dress?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Hancock hopes his research will help companies work our the best ways for their employees to communicate. For instance, the phone might be the best medium foe sales where employees are encouraged to stretch the truth. But, given his result, work assessment where honesty is a priority, might be best done using email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	In a country that defines itself by ideals, not by shared blood, who should be allowed to come work and live here? In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks these questions have never seemed more pressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	On Dec. 11, 2001, as part of the effort to increase homeland security, federal and local authorities in 14 states staged &amp;ldquo;Operation Safe Travel&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;raids on airports to arrest employees with false identification (身份证明). In Salt Lake City there were 69 arrests. But those captured were anything but terrorists, most of them illegal immigrants from Central or South America. Authorities said the undocumented workers&amp;rsquo; illegal status made them open to blackmail (讹诈) by terrorists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Many immigrants in Salt Lake City were angered by the arrests and said they felt as if they were being treated like disposable goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Mayor Anderson said those feelings were justified to a certain extent. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re saying we want you to work in these places, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are, and then when it&amp;rsquo;s convenient for us, or when we can try to make a point in terms of national security, especially after Sept. 11, then you&amp;rsquo;re disposable. There are whole families being uprooted for all of the wrong reasons,&amp;rdquo; Anderson said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	If Sept. 11 had never happened, the airport workers would not have been arrested and could have gone on quietly living in America, probably indefinitely. Ana Castro, a manager at a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s ice cream shop at the airport had been working 10 years with the same false Social Security card when she was arrested in the December airport raid. Now she and her family are living under the threat of deportation (驱逐出境). Castro&amp;rsquo;s case is currently waiting to be settled. While she awaits the outcome, the government has granted her permission to work here and she has returned to her job at Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
