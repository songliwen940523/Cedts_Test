        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Rushmoore National Monument&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The well-known Rushmoore National Monument in the United States is erected （使竖立） on the Rushmoore Peak, 1829 meters above sea level, of the Black Hills in the south — west of South Dakota. It is a group of huge stone statues of four American presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Licoln and Theodore Roosevelt. President Washington is the founding father of the country; the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U．S．Declaration of Independence; the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation （独立宣言） and the 26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All the four presidents made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U.S. history.&lt;br/&gt;        The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota, with a view to carrying forward the U.S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The famed artist Gutzon Borglum, a naturalized Danish-American, made the design and was in charge of the project of historic significance. It was the 30th President Calvin Coolidge who announced in 1927 the start of the stone work. But before the work done, the sculptor passed away when he was 73 years of age. He was then succeeded by his son, and it was not until 1941 that the National Monument was put up.&lt;br/&gt;        As the stone statues were rather enormous, technology of directional blasting was resorted to in the main. Explosives were used to blow up the peak into models first, and then the stonemasons carved them into statues with tools. The broken stones weighed about four hundred fifty thousand tons in total. This project was the fruit of arduous （辛勤的） work done by a contingent of 360 odd masons （石工） in as long as 14 years. A sum of one million dollar was expended.&lt;br/&gt;        The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world, taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20 sq mt, with a 20-meter long face, a 7-meter long nose, a 2.6-meter wide mouth and two 1.5-meter wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction, they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. &lt;br/&gt;        Since the stone sculpture is unique in style, the Monument is now the U．S．National Art Centre of Popular Education. Groups of people keep streaming everyday to the site for a visit and tourists across the world are also interested in taking a view of this colossal （庞大的） Monument.</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;From Trash to Treasure&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Early on a Saturday morning, much of the world remains in bed, enjoying an extra hour or two of sleep. But a few Americans are up and preparing for the hunt. Armed with the newspaper yard-sale listings, they plan to be the first to arrive at the sales. What are these yard-sale shoppers hunting for? Secondhand treasures, of course!&lt;br/&gt;        Yard-sale shoppers aren't the only people who like used goods. From Australia to U.S.A., Westerners love to buy other people's stuff. Even the wealthy willingly search through used goods looking for a unique treasure.&lt;br/&gt;        Some people buy used goods simply to save money. Others hunt through them hoping to find a valuable antique. Still others look for items to add to their collections. &lt;br/&gt;        Some items remind people of childhood. A flour tin from the 1940s may bring back memories of Mom's homemade cookies. A copy of a favorite children's book can remind someone of bedtime stories with Dad. &lt;br/&gt;        True antique must be at least 100 years old. But any item that is no longer made can be a collectible and some hold great value.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Old is Old?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        For those in Asia, where 5,000-year-old vases sit in museums, Western antiques don't seem too old. But for Americans, items even a few decades old have value. An ice-cream maker from the 1920s could be worth US$50. A sign from World War I could sell for US$4,000 or more. &lt;br/&gt;        Some who collect want to make money and become antique dealers. They carefully look over items for any flaws （瑕疵） that would lower the item's value. They take classes and read books to learn which items will increase in value or are desirable to collectors. &lt;br/&gt;        Others simply buy whatever catches their fancy. If people enjoy rock 'n' roll music, they might collect old records. A tea drinker may collect antique teacups. Those not looking to make money suggest, "Don't buy it unless it's useful."&lt;br/&gt;        The trick is finding new ways to use old items. For example, an old-fashioned clothes iron may be used as a bookend. An old children's toy wagon could display books or teddy bears in a guest room. An antique quilt could be hung on the wall for display. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Find Collectibles&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Secondhand goods can be found in all sorts of places. Saturday morning yard sales are just the beginning. Flea markets are another hot spot for collectibles. You won't find bugs, but you may find yard tools, arts and crafts, and furniture.&lt;br/&gt;        Shopping at a flea market for the first time can be overwhelming. Tables piled high with junk fill large rooms or outdoor markets. And you have to look through it all yourself to find anything worth taking home. For antique lovers, however, finding just the right treasure makes all that looking worthwhile. &lt;br/&gt;        More valuable pieces are typically found in antique auctions. You can find them in cities or online. In today's world of technology, someone in California can buy a mirror from a shop in Maine without leaving home. &lt;br/&gt;        You don't have to spend money to enjoy secondhand shopping. An afternoon wandering antique shops and flea markets can be a mini history lesson. Old movie posters may catch your eye, or an old piano. Each piece brings the past to life. You never knew what treasures you're going to find in someone else's trash.</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Brainstorming in Three Easy Steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Sometimes, it's the easiest writing assignments that send us for a loop. Coming up with something to write about can often be harder than the actual writing. Luckily, there is an easy solution to that-brainstorming. Brainstorming comes in many different forms. Choosing the right method of brainstorming is a fun and easy task! &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Freewriting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Freewriting is the easiest form of brainstorming. The method is very simple: write! Freewriting is most often a timed exercise. The best way to freewrite is to choose your method of writing (either on the computer or with pen and paper) and simply write whatever comes to mind for approximately five minutes. Don't worry about spelling, grammar or clarity-none of those issues matter in freewriting. Keeping your words flowing is the most important part. Even if you have to write, "I can't think of anything to write," you're still doing the exercise correctly. What's great about freewriting is that it allows ideas that might be buried to come to the surface. Sometimes you have several possible topics in your head but nerves or fear keep them buried. Freewriting takes away any stumbling blocks and leaves you with only words. You'll be amazed at how many potential topics you come up with! &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Clustering&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        The clustering method works best when you have a general idea of a topic you're interested in writing about but that seems to be a bit too broad. For example, if you wanted to write about education, you would need to pick a more specified topic. Clustering works by allowing your mind to make connections visually. To brainstorm using the clustering method, simply write your broad topic in the middle of a sheet of paper and circle it. Then, create subtopics by drawing lines from your main topic to your new point, which you have also circled. As you find more subtopics, create new lines and circles. You'll also want to create subtopics for your subtopics. Creating this web of ideas will help you narrow your focus and also find new topics that you weren't aware of. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Question Method&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        My favorite form of brainstorming comes a little later in the writing process. Once you have chosen a topic to write about, it is important to get feedback. Sometimes a chosen topic is good but could be more precise. The best way to get feedback is to create a question group. To do this, you should form a group of several people. Each person should write his or her topic down on the top of a sheet of paper. Once this is completed, pass around the sheets of paper with topics. Each time you receive a topic sheet, ask a question about that topic that hasn't been asked yet. This will require you to think about new topics you haven't seen, but it will also give the writer new ideas to consider about the topic. I've used this method several times in English courses and always had great success. &lt;br/&gt;        As you can see, brainstorming doesn't need to be a complicated process. Take advantage of the ease of brainstorming and also the fun you can have with it! You'll have better topics to write about and more exciting ideas to focus on!</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        "Please pass the turkey and dressing." What does this simple request make you think about? If you are an American, you think about Thanksgiving. A turkey dinner symbolizes Thanksgiving for Americans. What does Thanksgiving remind Americans of? Their families. Thanksgiving is a family time. On this holiday, families gather to gobble up the gobbler and stuff themselves with stuffing. Family members enjoy watching parades and football games on TV and just being together. What does "family" mean to Americans? &lt;br/&gt;        The traditional American family is a "nuclear family." A nuclear family refers to a husband and wife and their children. The average American family today has two or three children (and maybe a few pets). In some cultures, people live close to their extended family. Several generations may even live together. In America, only in a few cases does more than one household live under one roof. &lt;br/&gt;        American values receive a warm welcome in the home. Many homes are run like a democracy. Each family member can have a say. A sense of equality often exists in American homes. Instead of fearing Mom and Dad, children may think of them as good friends. Husbands and wives often share household chores. In many cases, a child can enjoy privacy in his or her own bedroom. From an early age, children gain responsibility in handling money. They may receive a weekly allowance or even work part-time jobs. Often parents give children freedom to make their own decisions. Preschoolers choose what clothes to wear or which toys to buy. Young adults generally make their own choices about what career to pursue and whom to marry. &lt;br/&gt;        Families in America, like those in every culture, face many problems. Social pressures are breaking apart more and more American homes. Over half of U.S. marriages now end in divorce. More than one in four American children are growing up in single-parent homes. As a result, many people believe the American family is in trouble. &lt;br/&gt;        Even so, there is still reason for hope. Many organizations are working hard to strengthen families. Americans almost unanimously believe that the family is one of the most important parts of life. The vast majority also feel that the traditional two-parent family is best for children. They realize that problems in family life in recent years have brought about serious consequences. As a result, more and more people are making their family a priority. &lt;br/&gt;        Many women are quitting their jobs to stay home with their children. Families are going on vacations and outings together. Husbands and wives are making a concentrated effort to keep their marriages solid. &lt;br/&gt;        The United Nations has declared 1994 the "International Year of the Family". Not just in America, but all over the world, people recognize the importance of strong families. How do you strengthen the family bond? Do special things for each other. Talk to each other. Play together. Spend time together. Oh, and one more thing: be thankful for each other. If you have a family, every day should be Thanksgiving.</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Packaging: the Insane Waste of Making Things to Be Thrown away&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        To get a chocolate out of a box requires a considerable amount of unpacking: the box has to be taken out of the paper bag in which it arrived; the cellophane （玻璃纸） wrapper has to be taken off, the lid opened and the paper removed; the chocolate itself then has to be unwrapped from its own piece of paper. But this insane amount of wrapping is not confined to luxuries. It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in cellophane, polythene （聚乙烯）, or paper.&lt;br/&gt;        The package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London household each week. So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling. This is absurd. Packaging is using up scarce energy and resource and messing up the environment.&lt;br/&gt;        Little research is being carried out on the costs of alternative types of packaging. Just how possible is it, for instance, for local authorities to salvage （救助） paper, pulp （使化为纸浆） it, and recycle it as egg-boxes? Would it be cheaper to plant another forest? Paper is the material most used for packaging-20 million paper bags are apparently used in Great Britain each day-but very little is salvaged. &lt;br/&gt;        A machine has been developed that pulps paper then processes it into packaging, e.g. egg-boxes and cartons. This could be easily adapted for local authority use. It would mean that people would have to separate their refuse into paper and non-paper, with different dustbin for each. Paper is, in fact, probably the material that can be most easily recycled; and now, with massive increases in paper prices, the time has come at which collection by local authorities could be profitable. &lt;br/&gt;        Recycling of this kind is already happening with milk bottles, which are returned to the dairies, washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More and more dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles, and it has been estimated that if all the milk bottles necessary were made of plastic, then British dairies would be producing the equivalent of enough plastic tubing to encircle the earth every five or six days! &lt;br/&gt;        The trouble with plastic is that it does not rot. Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever growing mounds of plastic containers is to do away with plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many manufacturers who say there is no alternative to their handy plastic packs. &lt;br/&gt;        It is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers as opposed to producing new ones. Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and making things look better so more people will buy them is clearly becoming increasingly absurd. But it is not so much a question of doing away with packaging as using it sensibly. What is needed now is a more sophisticated approach to using scarce resources for what is, after all, a relatively unimportant function.</Content>

	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Learning to play a musical instrument can change your brain, with a US review finding music training can lead to improved speech and foreign language skills.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Although it has been suggested in the past that listening to Mozart or other (_1_)&amp;nbsp; music could make you smarter, there has been little evidence to show that music (_2_)&amp;nbsp; brain power.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But a data-driven review by Northwestern University has pulled together research that links musical training to learning that (_3_) into skills including language, speech, memory, attention and even vocal emotion.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Researcher Nina Kraus said the data (_4_) suggested that the neural connections made during musical training also primed the brain for other aspects of human communication.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;The effect of music training suggests that, similar to physical exercise and its (_5_) on body fitness, music is a resource that tones the brain for auditory fitness and thus requires society to re-examine the role of music in shaping (_6_) development,&amp;rdquo; the researchers said in their study.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Kraus said learning musical sounds could (_7_) the brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to adapt and change and also enable the nervous system to provide supporting (_8_) that are important to learning.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The study, published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience, looked at the explosion of research in recent years (_9_) the effects of music training on the nervous system which could have strong implications for education.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The study found that playing an instrument prepares the brain to choose what&amp;nbsp; is&amp;nbsp; relevant in a complex process that may involve reading or remembering a score, timing issues and (_10_) other musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
