        </Questions>
        <Script>“Google”, the popular Internet search engine, offers a page called “Google News”, a summary of what is going on in a world inhabited entirely by computers.
   Clearly, the day is approaching when editors can be replaced by computers. This requires some urgent rethinking.
   Throughout the revolution of technology and globalization that has been going on for two decades, many believe that progress is a good thing. Some people are unfortunately caught in the wheels of change, but society as a whole benefits.
   We must distinguish, however, between making an exception and being worried about deeply troubling developments. It is one thing to sacrifice textile workers for progress. It is quite another to start throwing reporters into the flames of progress. It's very different.
   You see, journalists are responsible for reporting and analyzing the important issues of the day. In the prestige ranking of important issues, a key factor is how much an issue actually touches anyone's daily life.
   What happens when all the human editors have been eliminated? We know the answer from the movie "2001". In the movie a computer took over a space station and killed all the inhabitants. We will wake up one day to find that all the news is about the narrow-minded concerns of computers while important human developments get ignored.
   No doubt there are writers and policy analysts of all sorts who think today "They are going after editors, but I can never be replaced by a machine." Ladies and gentleman, that's what the editor thought.</Script>

        <Script>Each university and college in the United States has different requirements for gaining admission to their MBA programs. There are also several different types of MBA programs available. Here is a brief outline of the different types of MBAs offered:
&lt;B&gt;1. Full-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The full-time MBA offers core courses that span all management disciplines. Students can also select from a variety of optional courses. The program usually takes between 18 and 24 months to complete. Students must attend classes at the business school on most weekdays. 
&lt;B&gt;2. Part-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The part-time MBA offers core courses and optional courses similar to the full-time program. Some schools allow students up to 7 years to complete their study, though the majority of part-time students will complete the program in 2 or 3 years. The part-time program usually appeals to students who are currently working, so classes are held at night and/or on the weekends. 
&lt;B&gt;3. On-Line MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The on-line program offers a core of general courses with a limited number of optional courses. The programs can take up to 8 years to complete, though students generally finish in 3 or 4 years. Coursework uses e-mail, computer conferencing, chat rooms, on-line bulletin boards, and sound and video clips. It is very important to make sure the program is recognized so hiring companies will consider it valid. 
&lt;B&gt;4. Executive MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The executive MBA, or EMBA, is generally designed for senior managers with at least 10 years of business experience. The courses tend to focus on global business issues and strategies. The program is very structured, with courses offered in sequence and students moving as one through the various steps. The program is generally considered full-time and can take up to 24 months to complete. Usually classes are held on the weekends and the work requires group projects and meetings.

        <Script>The convenience and economy of small cars account for their popularity. They are easy to park quickly and take smaller parking spaces. Small cars are also a means of conserving energy because they use less gas than big cars. Small cars are inconvenient and uncomfortable on long trips. However, because of their limited passenger and trunk space, they are also more economical to operate and maintain. And they cost less. Because of all these advantages, the next car I buy is going to be an Econo-Midget.</Script>

        <Script>Domestic pets cause most animal bites. Dogs are more likely to bite than cats. Cat bites, however, are more likely to cause infection. Bites from nonimmunized domestic animals and wild animals carry the risk of rabies. Rabies is more common in raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes than in cats and dogs. Rabbits, squirrels and other rodents rarely carry rabies. If an animal bites you or your child, follow these guidelines:
&lt;b&gt;For minor wounds.&lt;/b&gt; If the bite barely breaks the skin and there is no danger of rabies, treat it as a minor wound. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic cream to prevent infection and cover the bite with a clean bandage. 
&lt;b&gt;For deep wounds.&lt;/b&gt; If the animal bite creates a deep puncture of the skin or the skin is badly torn and bleeding, apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding and see your doctor. 
&lt;b&gt;For infection.&lt;/b&gt; If you notice signs of infection such as swelling, redness, increased pain or oozing, see your doctor immediately. 
&lt;b&gt;For suspected rabies.&lt;/b&gt; If you suspect the bite was caused by an animal that might carry rabies - any bite from a wild or domestic animal of unknown immunization status - see your doctor immediately. Doctors recommend getting a tetanus shot every 10 years. If your last one was more than five years ago and your wound is deep or dirty, your doctor may recommend a booster. You should have the booster within 48 hours of the injury.</Script>

        </Questions>
        <Script>Every animal is a living radiator --- heat formed in its cells is given off through its skin. Warm-blooded animals maintain a temperature by constantly replacing lost surface heat; smaller animals, which have more skin for every ounce of body weight, must produce heat faster than bigger ones. Because smaller animals burn fuel faster, scientists say they live faster. 

The speed at which an animal lives is determined by measuring the rate at which it uses oxygen. A chicken, for example, uses one-half cubic centimeter of oxygen every hour for each gram it weighs. The tiny shrew uses four cubic centimeters of oxygen every hour for each gram it weighs. Because it uses oxygen eight times as fast, it is said that the mouselike shrew is living eight times as fast as the chicken. The smallest of the warm-blooded creatures, the humming-bird, lives a hundred times as fast as an elephant. 

There is limit to how small a warm-blooded animal can be. A mammal or bird that weighed only two and a half grams would starve to death. It would burn up its food too rapidly and would not be able to eat fast enough to supply more fuel.</Script>
