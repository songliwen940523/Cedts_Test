        <Script>M: Hi, Sis. I just came over to drop of the DVDs you wanted, and . . . Hey, wow!? Where did you get all of this stuff? 
W: I bought it. So, what do you think of my new entertainment center? And the widescreen screen TV . . . 
M: Bought it? 
W: . . . and my new DVD player. Here, let me show you my stereo. You can really rock the house with this one. 
M: But where did you get the money to buy all this? You didn't borrow money from mom and dad again, did you? 
W: Of course not. I got it with this! 
M: This? Let me see that . . . Have you been using Dad's credit card again? 
W: No, silly. It's mine. It's a student credit card. 
M: A student credit card? How in the world did you get one of these? 
W: I got an application in the mail. 
M: Well, why did you get one in the first place? 
W: Listen. Times are changing, and having a credit card helps you build a credit rating, control spending, and even buy things that you can't pay with cash.
M: I don't want to hear it. Anyway, student credit cards just lead to impulse spending . . . as I can see here. And the interest rates of student credit cards are usually sky high, and if you miss a payment, the rates, well, just jump!</Script>

        <Script>M: How are you doing today?
W: Good, thanks.
M: Now, I hear that you are going back home to New Zealand.
W: That's right. I'm going home for summer.
M: OK. What are your plans?
W: Probably a week relaxing, going camping, and then I'm going back to work.
M: OK. Where do you work?
W: I teach as an English teacher in Christchurch, in New Zealand.
M: And that's where you're from, naturally.
W: That's right.
M: Were you born there?
W: I was, yeah!
M: Well, you are going to have this short little break, or vacation, are you going to the beach or the mountains?
W: Probably to the beach and camping for about a week with friends, yeah!
M: Actually, how warm is it in the summer?
W: Probably a maximum of about 30 degrees. A nice dry heat! Very comfortable.
M: So when you go to the beach, is the water warm enough to swim in?
W: No, no, no! We swim but it is not warm. Yeah! It's pretty chilly actually.
M: OK. Any other plans when you go home?
W: Yeah, I'm looking forward to catching up with friends and family and animals.
M: Animals? 
W: Well, I miss my pets. 
M: OK, well, what pets do you have?
W: Well, I have a cat and a dog and a sheep called Sydney and two goldfish. 
M: Wow!
W: Yeah! And I really miss them. 
M: I'm sure they're really excited to see you, too.</Script>

        <Script>The word OKAY is known and used by millions of people all over the world. Still, language experts do not agree on where it came from.
Some say it came from the American Indians. Some say that President Andrew Jackson first used the word. Others claim the word was invented by John Jacob Astor, a fur trader of the late 1700s who became one of the world's richest men. Still others say a poor railroad clerk made up this word. His name was Obadiah Kelly and put his initials, O.K., on each package people gave him to ship by train.
But perhaps the most believable explanation is that the word okay was invented by a political organization in the 1800s. Martin Van Buren was running for president. A group of people organized a club to support him. They called it the "Okay Club". The letter "O" and "K" were taken from the name of Van Buren's home town, Old Kinderhook, New York.</Script>

        <Script>There are three important findings from studies concerned with note-taking. First, note-taking does not interfere with listening and comprehension; in fact, it helps you listen. Second, students who study their lecture notes remember one and a half times more after six weeks than students who do not review. Third, students who take no notes, or do not study their notes, forget approximately 80% of the lecture by the end of two weeks. From these findings we can conclude that students, who take enough notes and then study them both directly after the lecture and several additional times before an examination, stand a good chance of remembering between 90% and 100% of the material. In other words, if you don't take notes, then you will put yourself at a disadvantage.</Script>

        <Script>Now I'd like to talk to you about the final exam. The exam will be held next Thursday, the last day of exam week. Remember to bring along two or three pens in case you run out of ink. Unlike the mid-term this test will not include multiple choice questions. It will consist entirely of essays. You'll have to answer three of the five essay questions. The exam will be comprehensive, which means you will be responsible for all of the subject material we've covered in class. I would suggest you review your mid-term's as well as the textbook and your class notes. The final will count for 50% of your grade in the course; the research project will count for 20% percent; and the mid-term 30%. I'll be in my office almost all day on Tuesday of next week. If you run into any problems, please feel free to stop in. Good luck with your studying and I'll see you on Thursday.</Script>

        <Content>        While you can retrieve（取回） cash from your bank account anywhere in the world and maintain your bank records online, the Americans seldom maintain their health records by using software, hardware and Internet connections.&lt;br/&gt;        This is because the (_1_) system has lagged（滞后） in using information technology. Only an (_2_) 10 percent to 20 percent of the U.S. hospitals and (_3_) offices maintain fully computerized patient records.&lt;br/&gt;        But with many of us taking a greater interest in our health care — partly by researching health information online — some experts believe the time is (_4_) for patients to create their own electronic personal health record, also (_5_) a PHR.&lt;br/&gt;        A PHR is a (_6_) record that you own, control and maintain over time. You decide when to share its contents — in response to a doctor's (_7_) or because you think there is something more a doctor needs to know about your health history.&lt;br/&gt;        Your personal health record should be (_8_), easily portable, private and secure. The contents will (_9_) such essentials as your current medications and dosages（配药）, health-insurance info, living will, immunizations（使免疫） with dates, allergies（ [医]敏感症）, important recent medical test results, (_10_), family medical-history highlights and so on.&lt;br/&gt;        Proponents say a personal health record can help health providers work more quickly, avoid errors and duplication of tests, and save lives.</Content>

        <Content>        By using power-driven machines in factories and by developing efficient mass production methods, Americans have greatly increased the ability of the individual worker to produce goods. Because the production of each worker has increased from year to year, Americans have been able to buy and use an increasing number of things to make their lives more pleasant and comfortable than those of their forefathers. It is hard to believe that automobiles, radios, motion pictures, frozen foods, electric refrigerators, to mention only a few items, have come into common use within the last thirty years.</Content>

        <Content>        Some psychologists maintain that mental acts such as thinking are not performed in the brain alone, but that one's muscles also participate. It may be said that we think with our muscles in somewhat the same way that we listen to music with our bodies.&lt;br/&gt;        You surely are not surprised to be told that you usually listen to music not only with your ears but with your whole body. Few people can listen to music that is more or less familiar without moving their body or, more specifically, some part of their body. Often when one listens to a symphonic (交响乐) concert on the radio, he is tempted to direct the orchestra even though he knows there is a competent conductor on the job.&lt;br/&gt;        Strange as this behavior may be, there is a very good reason for it. One cannot derive all possible enjoyment from music unless he participates, so to speak, in its performance. The listener "feels" himself into the music with more or less pronounced motions of his body.&lt;br/&gt;        The muscles of the body actually participate in the mental process of thinking in the same way, but this participation is less obvious because it is less pronounced.</Content>

        <Content>        One day a police officer managed to get some fresh mushrooms. He was so (_1_) what he had bought that he offered to (_2_) the mushrooms with his brother officers.

The dog seemed to (_5_) his mushrooms, and the officers then began to eat their meal saying that the mushrooms had a very strong (_6_) quite pleasant taste.&lt;br/&gt;        An hour (_7_), however, they were all astonished when the gardener rushed on and said (_8_) the dog was dead.

"Did it (_17_) much before death?" asked one of the officers, (_18_) very pleased that he had escaped a (_19_) death himself. "No," answered the gardener looking rather (_20_).
