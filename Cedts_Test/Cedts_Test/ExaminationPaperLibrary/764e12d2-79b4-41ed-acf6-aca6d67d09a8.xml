        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Universities Branch Out&lt;br/&gt;	　　As never before in their long history, universities have become instruments of national competition as well as instruments of peace. They are the place of the scientific discoveries that move economies forward, and the primary means of educating the talent required to obtain and maintain competitive advantage. But at the same time, the opening of national borders to the flow of goods, services, information and especially people has made universities a powerful force for global integration, mutual understanding and geopolitical stability.&lt;br/&gt;	　　In response to the same forces that have driven the world economy, universities have become more self-consciously global: seeking students from around the world who represent the entire range of cultures and values, sending their own students abroad to prepare them for global careers, offering course of study that address the challenges of an interconnected world and collaborative (合作的) research programs to advance science for the benefit of all humanity.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Of the forces shaping higher education none is more sweeping than the movement across borders. Over the past three decades the number of students leaving home each year to study abroad has grown at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, from 800,000 in 1975 to 2.5 million in 2004. Most travel from one developed nation to another, but the flow from developing to developed countries is growing rapidly. The reverse flow, from developed to developing countries, is on the rise, too. Today foreign students earn 30 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in the United States and 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom. And the number crossing borders for undergraduate study is growing as well, to 8 percent of the undergraduates at America&amp;rsquo;s best institutions and 10 percent of all undergraduates in the U.K. In the United States, 20 percent of the newly hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born, and in China many newly hired faculty members at the top research universities received their graduate education abroad.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Universities are also encouraging students to spend some of their undergraduate years in another country. In Europe, more than 140,000 students participate in the Erasmus program each year, taking courses for credit in one of 2,200 participating institutions across the continent. And in the United States, institutions are helping place students in the summer internships (实习) abroad to prepare them for global careers. Yale and Harvard have led the way, offering every undergraduate at least one international study or internship opportunity&amp;mdash;and providing the financial resources to make it possible.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Globalization is also reshaping the way research is done. One new trend involves sourcing portions of a research program to another country. Yale professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Tian Xu directs a research center focused on the genetics of human disease at Shanghai&amp;rsquo;s Fudan University, in collaboration with faculty colleagues from both schools. The Shanghai center has 95 employees and graduate students working in a 4,300-square-meter laboratory seminars with scientists from both campuses. The arrangement benefits both countries; Xu&amp;rsquo;s Yale lab is more productive, thanks to the lower costs of conducting research in China, and Chinese graduate students, postdoctors and faculty get on-the-job training from a world-class scientist and his U.S. team.&lt;br/&gt;	　　As a result of its strength in science, the United States has consistently led the world in the commercialization of major new technologies, from the mainframe computer and the integrated circuit of the 1960s to the Internet infrastructure (基础设施) and applications software of the 1990s. the link between university-based science and industrial application is often indirect but sometimes highly visible: Silicon Valley was intentionally created by Stanford University, and Route 128 outside Boston has long housed companies spun off from MIT and Harvard. Around the world, governments have encouraged copying of this model, perhaps most successfully in Cambridge, England, where Microsoft and scores of other leading software and biotechnology companies have set up shop around the university.&lt;br/&gt;	　　For all its success, the United States remains deeply hesitant about sustaining the research- university model. Most politicians recognize the link between investment in science and national economic strength, but support for research funding has been unsteady. The budget of the National Institutes of Health doubled between 1998 and 2003, but has risen more slowly than inflation since then. Support for the physical sciences and engineering barely kept pace with inflation during that same period. The attempt to make up lost ground is welcome, but the nation would be better served by steady, predictable increases in science funding at the rate of long-term GDP growth, which is on the order of inflation plus 3 percent per year.&lt;br/&gt;	　　American politicians have great difficult recognizing that admitting more foreign students can greatly promote the national interest by increasing international understanding. Adjusted for inflation, public funding for international exchanges and foreign-language study is well below the levels of 40 years ago, in the wake of September 11, changes in the visa process caused a dramatic decline in the number of foreign students seeking admission to U.S. universities, and a corresponding surge in enrollments in Australia, Singapore and the U.K. Objections from American university and the business leaders led to improvements in the process and reversal of the decline, but the United States is still seen by many as unwelcoming to international students.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Most Americans recognize that universities contribute to the nation&amp;rsquo;s well-being through their scientific research, but many fear that foreign students threaten American competitiveness by taking their knowledge and skills back home. They fail to grasp that welcoming foreign students to the United States has two important positive effects: first, the very best of them stay in the States and&amp;mdash; like immigrants throughout history&amp;mdash;strengthen the nation; and second, foreign students who study in the United States become ambassadors for many of its most cherished (珍视) values when they return home. Or at least they understand them better. In America as elsewhere, few instruments of foreign policy are as effective in promoting peace and stability as welcoming international university students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	　　M: Mary, I hope you&amp;#39;re packed and ready to leave.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m packed, but not quite ready. I can&amp;rsquo;t find my passport.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Your passport? That&amp;rsquo;s the one thing you mustn&amp;rsquo;t leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: I know. I haven&amp;rsquo;t lost it. I&amp;rsquo;ve packed it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which bag it&amp;rsquo;s in.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, you have to find it at the airport. Come on, the taxi is waiting.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Did you say taxi? I thought we were going in your car.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Yes, well, I have planned to, but I&amp;rsquo;ll explain later. You&amp;rsquo;ve got to be there in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: The plane doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave for two hours. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to go now.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Now, you&amp;#39;re taking just one case, is that right?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: No, there is one in the hall as well.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Gosh, what a lot of stuff! You&amp;#39;re taking enough for a month instead of a week.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Well, you can&amp;rsquo;t depend on the weather. It might be cold.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: It&amp;rsquo;s never cold in Rome. Certainly not in May. Come on, we really must go.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Right, we&amp;#39;re ready. We&amp;rsquo;ve got the bags, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there&amp;#39;s no need to rush.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: There is. I asked the taxi driver to wait two minutes, not twenty.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Look, I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be going away to relax. You&amp;#39;re making me nervous.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, I want you to relax on holiday, but you can&amp;rsquo;t relax yet.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: OK, I promise not to relax, at least not until we get to the airport and I find my passport.&lt;br /&gt;

	　　W: Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m fed up with my job.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Hey, there&amp;#39;s a perfect job for you in the paper today. You might be interested.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Oh, what is it? What do they want?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Wait a minute. Uh, here it is. The European Space Agency is recruiting translators.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: The European Space Agency?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, that&amp;rsquo;s what it says. They need an English translator to work from French or German.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: So they need a degree in French or German, I suppose. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve got that. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I have plenty of experience. What else are they asking for?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Just that. A university degree and three or four years of experience as a translator in a professional environment. They also say the person should have a lively and inquiring mind, effective communication skills and the ability to work individually or as a part of the team.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Well, if I stay at my present job much longer, I won&amp;rsquo;t have any mind or skills left. By the way, what about salary? I just hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t lower than what I get now.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: It&amp;rsquo;s said to be negotiable. It depends on the applicant&amp;rsquo;s education and experience. In addition to basic salary, there&amp;#39;s a list of extra benefits. Have a look yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Hm, travel and social security plus relocation expenses are paid. Hey, this isn&amp;rsquo;t bad. I really want the job.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage 1&lt;br /&gt;
	　　When couples get married, they usually plan to have children. Sometimes, however, a couple can not have a child of their own. In this case, they may decide to adopt a child. In fact, adoption is very common today. There are about 60 thousand adoptions each year in the United Statesalone. Some people prefer to adopt infants, others adopt older children, some couples adopt children from their own countries, others adopt children from foreign countries. In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason ---- they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　Most adopted children know that they are adopted. Psychologists and child-care experts generally think this is a good idea. However, many adopted children or adoptees have very little information about their biological parents. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed. The information is secret so no one can see it. Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage 2&lt;br /&gt;
	　　Katherine Gram graduated from University of Chicago in 1938 and got a job as a news reporter in San Francisco. Katherine&amp;rsquo;s father used to be a successful investment banker. In 1933, he bought a failing newspaper, the Washington Post.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　Then Katherine returned to Washington and got a job, editing letters in her father&amp;rsquo;s newspaper. She married Philip Gram, who took over his father-in-law&amp;rsquo;s position shortly after and became publisher of the Washington Post. But for many years, her husband suffered from mental illness and he killed himself in 1963. After her husband&amp;rsquo;s death, Katherine operated the newspaper. In the 1970s, the newspaper became famous around the world and Katherine was also recognized as an important leader in newspaper publishing. She was the first woman to head a major American publishing company, the Washington Post company. In a few years, she successfully expanded the company to include newspaper, magazine, broadcast and cable companies.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　She died of head injuries after a fall when she was 84. More than 3 thousand people attended her funeral including many government and business leaders. Her friends said she would be remembered as a woman who had an important influence on events in the United States and the world. Katherine once wrote, &amp;ldquo;The world without newspapers would not be the same kind of world&amp;rdquo;. After her death, the employees of the Washington Post wrote, &amp;ldquo;The world without Katherine would not be the same at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage 3&lt;br /&gt;
	　　Obtaining good health insurance is a real necessity while you are studying overseas. It protects you from minor and major medical expenses that can wipe out not only your savings but your dreams of an education abroad. There are often two different types of health insurance you can consider buying, international travel insurance and student insurance in the country where you will be going.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　An international travel insurance policy is usually purchased in your home country before you go abroad. It generally covers a wide variety of medical services and you are often given a list of doctors in the area where you will travel who may even speak your native language. The drawback might be that you may not get your money back immediately, in other words, you may have to pay all you medical expenses and then later submit your receipts to the insurance company.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　On the other hand, getting student heath insurance in the country where you will study might allow you to only pay a certain percentage of the medical cost at the time of service and thus you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have sufficient cash to pay the entire bill at once. Whatever you decide, obtaining some form of health insurance is something you should consider before you go overseas. You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t wait until you are sick with major medical bills to pay off.&lt;br /&gt;
	Questions 33-35 are based on the passage you have just heard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In this age of Internet chat, videogames and reality television, there is no shortage of mindless activities to keep a child occupied. Yet, despite the competition, my 8-year-old daughter Rebecca wants to spend her leisure time writing short stories. She wants to enter one of her stories into a writing contest, a competition she won last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　As a writer I know about winning contests, and about losing them. I know what it is like to work hard on a story only to receive a rejection slip from the publisher. I also know the pressure of trying to live up to a reputation created by previous victories. What if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t win the contest again? That&amp;rsquo;s the strange thing about being a parent. So many of our own past scars and dashed hopes can surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　A revelation (启示) came last week when I asked her, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you want to win again?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; she replied, &amp;ldquo;I just want to tell the story of an angel going to first grade.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　I had just spent weeks correcting her stories as she spontaneously (自发地) told them. Telling myself that I was merely an experienced writer guiding the young writer across the hall, I offered suggestions for characters, conflicts and endings for her tales. The story about a fearful angel starting first grade was quickly &amp;ldquo;guided&amp;rdquo; by me into the tale of a little girl with a wild imagination taking her first music lesson. I had turned her contest into my contest without even realizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　Staying back and giving kids space to grow is not as easy as it looks. Because I know very little about farm animals who use tools or angels who go to first grade, I had to accept the fact that I was co-opting (借用) my daughter&amp;rsquo;s experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　While stepping back was difficult for me, it was certainly a good first step that I will quickly follow with more steps, putting myself far enough a way to give her room but close enough to help if asked. All the while I will be reminding myself that children need room to experiment, grow and find their own voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; By almost any measure, there is a boom in Internet-based instruction. In just a few years, 34 percent of American universities have begun offering some form of distance learning (DL), and among the larger schools, it&amp;rsquo;s close to 90 percent. If you doubt the popularity of the trend, you probably haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of the University of Phoenix. It grants degrees entirely on the basis of online instruction. It enrolls 90,000 students, a statistic used to support its claim to be the largest private university in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　While the kinds of instruction offered in these programs will differ, DL usually signifies a course in which the instructors post syllabi (课程大纲), reading assignment, and schedules on Websites, and students send in their assignments by e-mail. Generally speaking, face-to-face communication with an instructor is minimized or eliminated altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　The attraction for students might at first seem obvious. Primarily, there&amp;rsquo;s the convenience promised by courses on the Net: you can do the work, as they say, in your pajamas (睡衣). But figures indicate that the reduced effort results in a reduced commitment to the course. While dropout rate for all freshmen at American universities is around 20 percent, the rate for online students is 35 percent. Students themselves seem to understand the weaknesses inherent in the setup. In a survey conducted for eCornell, the DL division of Cornell University, less than a third of the respondents expected the quality of the online course to be as good as the classroom course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　Clearly, from the schools&amp;rsquo; perspective, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of money to be saved. Although some of the more ambitious programs require new investments in servers and networks to support collaborative software, most DL courses can run on existing or minimally upgraded (升级) systems. The more students who enroll in a course but don&amp;rsquo;t come to campus, the more school saves on keeping the lights on in the classrooms, paying doorkeepers, and maintaining parking lots. And, while there&amp;rsquo;s evidence that instructors must work harder to run a DL course for a variety of reasons, they won&amp;rsquo;t be paid any more, and might well be paid less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One factor that can influence consumers is their mood state. Mood may be defined&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_1_) a temporary and mild positive or negative feeling that is generalized and not tied&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_2_) any particular circumstance. Moods should be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_3_) from emotions which are usually more intense,&amp;nbsp;(_4_) &amp;nbsp;to specific circumstances, and often conscious.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_5_) one sense, the effect of a consumer&amp;rsquo;s mood can be thought of in&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_6_) the same way as can our reactions to the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_7_)of our friends&amp;mdash;when our friends are happy and &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo;, that trends to influence us positively,&amp;nbsp;(_8_) when they are &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo;, that can have a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_9_) impact on us. Similarly, consumers operating under a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_) mood state tend to react to stimuli (刺激因素) in a direction&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_11_) with that mood state. Thus, for example, we should expect to see&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_12_) in a positive mood state evaluate products in more of a&amp;nbsp;(_13_) manner than they would when not in such a state.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_14_), mood states appear capable of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_15_)a consumer&amp;rsquo;s memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　Moods appear to be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_16_) influenced by marketing techniques. For example, the rhythm, pitch, and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_17_) of music has been shown to influence behavior such as the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_18_) of time spent in supermarkets or&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_19_) to purchase products. In addition, advertising can influence consumers&amp;rsquo; moods which, in&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_20_),are capable of influencing consumer&amp;rsquo; reactions to products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
