        <Script>W: Now, do you mind my asking how old you are?
M: I was 80 years old on December 25th, 2006.
W: Wow! 80! What does it feel like to be 80?
M: It's a little inconvenient because my mind didn't turn 80 but my body did and I find sometimes my mind follows my body too!
W: For example?
M: It's hard to be as quick as I used to be and I can't do what I used to do when I was younger.
W: Oh, that's disappointing and probably a little frustrating.
M: Very frustrating! Especially when you have been active all of your life and all of a sudden, things begin to slow down.
W: Well, are there any advantages? Can you give us some hope?
M: Yes! Yes! There is hope. You have reached an age where you understand where you have been.
W: Could you explain it in more details?
M: I'm very fortunate that I lived in this age. I was born in 1926. I saw the airplane invented. I saw so many things, e.g. World War II, etc.
W: World war II?
M: Yes, World War II. I was married during World War II. So it's a good time. At 80 when you look back on all those things, you begin to understand the changes.You just become more knowledgeable when you become old.
W: Well, that doesn't sound so bad.</Script>

        <Script>The younger members of most American families don't like foreign food. They like hamburgers. Their idea of a good meal is a hamburger served with ketchup and French fried potatoes, which are called French fries. French fries are not considered foreign: most American children and teenagers love to eat them any time of the day or night.
Millions of hamburgers and French fries are eaten every year. Thousands of roadside restaurants prepare and sell them. These are not really restaurants in the usual sense; they often have little space for tables and chairs. Many people buy their hamburgers and take them home to eat, or eat them in their cars.
Sometimes it is not necessary to go inside in order to buy the hamburgers. They are ordered through a window in the restaurant and then are handed out through the window to the waiting customer. Sometimes the customer does not even have to get out of his car.
When an American family travels abroad, this is almost always the custom that the younger members of the family miss most.</Script>

        <Script>"Thank you" means that you appreciate what someone has done for you, very often, very small and most ordinary things. So we in the West thank people all day long. For instance, you will thank the saleswoman after she has attended to you. You will say "Thank you" to the waitress when she brings you a cup of coffee. And a teacher will say "Thank you" to a student who has just answered the question. At home, the husband will thank the wife when she brings him a glass of water. 
However, too many expressions of gratitude give Westerners the sense of empty thanks, and make them uncomfortable. For example, if an American has spent half an hour helping you write some letters, you will, of course, want to say, "Thank you, I really appreciate your time." That's enough. If you go on and on with statements of thanks, and even add "I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time", he will feel himself not thanked but annoyed and will not be anxious to help you again. And if he gets really annoyed, he might say, "Well, if you really think that you are wasting my time, you had better stay out of my way." There is also no need for you to apologize for your not being able to speak good English wherever you go and whomever you meet.</Script>

        <Script>What will happen in the year 2020? Well, in the home, cookers will be set so that you can cook a complete meal at the touch of a switch.
	Television will provide information on prices at the nearby shops as well as news and entertainment. Videophones will bring pictures as well as sound to telephone conversations.
	Machines will control temperature, lighting, entertainment, security alarms and gardening. Lighting will provide decoration as well as wallpaper. At work, robots will take over most jobs in the manufacturing industries. Working hours will fall to under 30 hours a week. Holidays will get longer. Six weeks will be the normal annual holiday. Men and women will retire at the same age. Our leisure will be different too. The home will become the center of entertainment through television and electronic games. More people will eat out in restaurants than they do today; also they will have a much wider variety of food available. Foreign travel will increase; winter holidays will become more popular than summer ones. Also non-stop flights among different countries will be cheap and easily available. Hobbies and education will become increasingly important.</Script>

        <Content>        If you partied hard on 31st night to welcome the New Year, then there's nothing worse than waking up with a hangover（宿醉）. Then why didn't you think before (_1_) those drinks? Believe it or not, there are (_2_) with which you can prevent hangovers. (_3_) of all don't drink! Well that really isn't an (_4_) this season, is it? To begin with, eat a large meal before you (_5_) start drinking. Have a glass of water between drinks once you start to drink. You can drink orange juice as it is a good (_6_) for hangovers. The sugar in the fruit gives you a boost（提高） of energy. Avoid fizzy（起泡沫的） drinks as they actually (_7_) up the alcohol absorption process so you get intoxicated（喝醉的） faster. Avoid coffee as the caffeine in it dehydrates（[使]脱水） you just like alcohol. Eat (_8_) as they are a natural enticer that helps cure nausea（恶心）.

        <Content>        An election year is one in which all four numbers are evenly divisible by four (1944,1948, etc.). Since 1840, American presidents elected in years ending in zero have been destined to die in office.&lt;br/&gt;        William H. Harrison, the man who served the shortest term, died of pneumonia several weeks after his inauguration.&lt;br/&gt;        Abraham Lincoln was one of four presidents who were assassinated. He was elected in 1860, and his untimely death came just five years later.&lt;br/&gt;        James A. Garfield, a former Union army general from Ohio, was shot during his first year in office (1881) by a man to whom he wouldn’t give a job.&lt;br/&gt;        While in his second term of office (1901), William McKinley, another Ohioan, attended the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York. During the reception, he was assassinated while shaking hands with some of the guests.&lt;br/&gt;        Three years after his election in 1920, Warren G. Harding died in office. Although it was never proved, many believe he was poisoned.&lt;br/&gt;        Franklin D. Roosevelt had been elected four times  (1932,1936,1940, and 1944), the only man to serve so long a term. He had contracted polio in 1921 and died of the illness in 1945.&lt;br/&gt;        John F. Kennedy, the last of the line, was assassinated in 1963, only three years after his election.</Content>

        <Content>        Cars of 2050 will travel the nation's highways in never-before-dreamed-of safety, comfort, and convenience. These cars will float along never touching the ground, and therefore will have no need for wheels.&lt;br/&gt;        Annoying highway vibrations, caused by the rotations of the disc-and-tire wheels, will be things of the past. The coming highway passenger cars will literally fly above the road, supported on columns of air compressed by turbine-driven (涡轮驱动的) fans.&lt;br/&gt;        The car without wheels has been called a "flying car", and, in a sense, that's just what it is; however, it will not back out of the family garage, start down the street, and then suddenly go quickly upward heading for some distant point. On the contrary, to avoid problems in aerial navigation, the wheelless vehicle probably will travel no more than three inches above road surface. It will travel over fairly rough road and even over smooth water!&lt;br/&gt;        The inevitable problems of maritime (水上的) regulations, severe weather conditions, and running out of fuel in remote areas all will require new concepts of operation, servicing, and vehicle regulation.</Content>
