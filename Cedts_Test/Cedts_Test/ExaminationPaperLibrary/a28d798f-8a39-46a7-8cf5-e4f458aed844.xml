        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	How Do You See Diversity?&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company .During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said &amp;ldquo;untrustworthy,&amp;rdquo; so she decided to offer the job to her second choice.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person,&amp;rdquo; Tiffany confesses. What she hadn&amp;rsquo;t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo; behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding . He was an Asian-American raised in a household where respect for those in authority was shown by averting(避开) your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I was just thrown off by the lack of ye contact; not realizing it was cultural,&amp;rdquo; Tiffany says. &amp;ldquo;I missed out ,but will not miss that opportunity again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;Many of us have had similar encounters with behaviors we perceive as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our under-standing of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions .&lt;br/&gt;	Hire Advantage&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult ,employers who can eliminate invalid biases(偏爱) from the process have a distinct advantage .My company, Mindsets LLC ,helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots . A real estate recruiter we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;During my Mindsets coaching session ,I was taught how to recruit a diversified workforce. I recruited people from different cultures and skill sets .The agents were able to utilize their full potential and experiences to build up the company .When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Blinded by Gender&lt;br/&gt;	Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops on supervising a diverse workforce . &amp;ldquo;Through one of the sessions ,I discovered my personal bias ,&amp;rdquo; he recalls . &amp;ldquo;I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person , and being open to differences .&amp;rdquo; In his case , the blindness was not about culture but rather gender .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I had a management position open in my department ;and the two finalists were a man and a woman . Had I not attended this workshop , I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel . My reasoning would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position , I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel .&amp;rdquo;Dale&amp;rsquo;s assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases into the situation , I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision .&amp;rdquo; Dale credits the workshop , &amp;ldquo;because it helped me make decisions based on fairness .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Year of the Know-It-All&lt;br/&gt;	Doug is another supervisor who attended one of my workshops .He recalls a major lesson learned from his own employee.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;One of my most embarrassing moments was when I had a Chinese-American employee put in a request to take time off to celebrate Chinese New Year . In my ignorance , I assumed he had his dates wrong , as the first of January had just passed . When I advised him of this , I gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;He patiently waited , then when I was done , he said he would like Chinese New Year did not begin January first , and that Chinese New Year ,which is tied to the lunar cycle ,is one of the most celebrated holidays on the Chinese calendar . Needless to say , I felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up . But I learned a great deal about assumptions , and that the timing of holidays varies considerably from culture to culture .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Attending the diversity workshop helped me realize how much I could learn by simply asking questions and creating dialogues with my employees , rather than making assumptions and trying to be a know-it-all ,&amp;rdquo; Doug admits . &amp;ldquo;The biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more &amp;lsquo;inclusive&amp;rsquo; to differences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	A better Bottom Line&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations internally , it is profitable as well . These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales .&amp;rdquo;Most of my customers speak English as a second language . One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone . It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until my boss received Mindsets&amp;rsquo; training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service . As result , our customer base has increased .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Once we start to see people as individuals . and discard the stereotypes , we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone . Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities . It is about building better communities and organizations that enhance us as individuals and reinforce our shared humanity .&lt;br/&gt;	When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers , family , friends , etc , we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are flawed(有缺陷的) or contrary to our fundamental values . We need to train our-selves to think differently , shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us ,creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	W: Bob, do you know who I saw the other day? Old Jake, looking terribly depressed. Did he get pensioned off at last?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes. They made him retire after 50 years at sea. He is pretty upset about it, but what can you do? He really is pasted.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: He is all alone, isn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes, his wife has been dead for years. They had one daughter, Dories. But she went off to town as soon as she left school. And he hasn&amp;#39;t heard from her since. I hear she is making good money as a model.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Maybe someone could get in touch with her. Get her to come back for a while to help?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I don&amp;#39;t suppose she come. She never got on with her father. He is bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish. Oh, I expect old Jake will get by. He is healthy at least, comes into a clinic for a check regularly.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Are you his doctor?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: No, my partner doctor Johnson is.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: That bad-tempered old thing?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh, he isn&amp;#39;t bad-tempered. He just looks it. He is an excellent doctor, taught me a lot, and he has a very nice family. His wife invites me over there to supper every week. Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: yes. I teach their daughter Pen at school. She is a bit careless and lazy about her school work, but a bright little thing and very popular with her age group.&lt;br /&gt;

	W: What can I do for you?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, unfortunately, there is a problem with the order we received from you yesterday. It seems we haven&amp;#39;t seen the right quantity of manuals to support the telephone system.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, dear, that&amp;#39;s bad news. I&amp;#39;m very sorry to hear that, and you don&amp;#39;t know how many packs are without manuals?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: No, because we haven&amp;#39;t opened every pack. But in several of those that have been opened there are none, no manuals.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I&amp;#39;m very sorry about this inconvenience, Mr. Summerfield. We&amp;#39;ll send out the manuals this afternoon by express mail entirely at our cost, and the manuals should arrive tomorrow or the day after at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: All of them, right?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes. It maybe that some have them already, but we cannot be sure. So the best thing is to send out the manual for every pack.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes. Yes, I see. That would be great.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Please accept our apologies for this mix-up. I assure you we will do everything possible to find out why the mistake happened&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Right. Thanks for your swift action.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Not at all. Thank you and goodbye for now. Do call if there is anything else.&lt;br /&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	Attracting and feeding wild birds are entertaining activities that have long been enjoyed by people all over the world. Feeding birds has become so popular that prepared feed mixtures are readily available. We feed birds for many reasons. Many pleasant hours can come from watching birds. A hobby often develops into a serious study of their habits. Accurate identification of birds is usually the first goal. But observations that an amateur bird-watcher can make are really limitless. There is, however, responsibility associated with bird feeding, including a disease hazard. Attracting numbers of birds continually to the same spot can be harmful to them, particularly species that pick food from the ground contaminated by the droppings of other birds. In winter feeding efforts are most satisfying to people and are of greatest benefit to birds. During this time when fewer natural foods are available and air temperatures are lower, extra feeding can keep a bird warm and well. Once begun, feeding should never stop during these lean months. If you start a local increase of birds, be prepared to do what may be required to eliminate hazards to those you want to befriend. A constant supply of food should be given until the cold is over and spring has come. If feeding is stopped during severe weather, birds used to relying upon the feeders must starve.&lt;br /&gt;

	My friend Leo makes up weak and poor excuses whenever there is something he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to do. Just two weeks ago, he was at my house when he decided he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go into work. He called his boss and said he had to get a new set of tires put on his truck. Then he sat down and watched TV with me. Not only had he lied but his excuse wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very convincing one. Another time, he cancelled a date with his girlfriend at the last minute telling her he had to get a new battery for his truck. She was angry and refused to go out with him again until he apologized. Last weekend, Leo offered the poorest excuse yet. He&amp;rsquo;d promised he&amp;rsquo;d help me move some furniture, from my parents&amp;rsquo; house to my new apartment. He was supposed to bring his truck over about 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock Saturday morning. I waited, and then called and left a message on his machine. About 11:30, he called and said he was sorry but he&amp;rsquo;d been getting a new set of tires put on his truck. I guess he&amp;rsquo;d forgotten he used the same excuse when he called his boss from my house. I think I need a new set of friends. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to get tired of Leo&amp;rsquo;s excuses.&lt;br /&gt;

	In Hollywood, everybody wants to be rich, famous and beautiful. Nobody wants to be old, unknown and poor. For Hollywood kids, life can be difficult because they grow up such an unreal atmosphere. Their parents are ambitious and the children are part of the parents&amp;rsquo; ambitions. Parents pay for wasteful grand parties, expensive cars and designer clothes. When every dream can come true, kids don&amp;rsquo;t learn the value of anything because they have everything. A thirteen-year-old boy, Trent Maguire, has a driver, credit cards and unlimited cash to do what he wants when he wants to. &amp;quot;One day, I&amp;rsquo;ll earn more than my dad!&amp;quot; he boasts. Parents buy care and attention for their children because they have no time to give it themselves. Amender&amp;rsquo;s mother employs a personal trainer, a bodyguard, a singing coach and a councilor to look after all her fifteen-year-old daughter&amp;rsquo;s needs. Often, there is no parent at home most days, so children decide whether to make their own meals or go out to restaurants, when to watch television or do homework. They organize their social life. They play no childhood games. They become adults before they&amp;rsquo;re ready. Hollywood has always been the city of dreams. The kids there live unreal lives where money, beauty and pleasure are the only gods. Will children around the world soon start to think the same? Or do they already?&lt;br /&gt;

	Around 120 years ago, Ebbinghaus began his study of memory. He (_1_) . on studying how quickly the human mind can remember (_2_) . One result of his research is known as the total time hypothesis(假设), which simply means the amount you learn (_3_) on the time you spend trying to learn it . This can be taken as our first rule of learning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Although it is usually true that studying for four hours is better than studying for one, there is still the question of how we should use the four hours. For example, is it better to study for four hours (_4_) or to study for one hour a day for four days in a (_5_) ?. The answer, as you may have (_6_) , is that it is better to spread out the study times. This (_7_) , through which we can learn more&amp;nbsp;(_8_) .by dividing our practice time, is known as the distribution of practice effect. Thus, (_9_) . &amp;nbsp;But we&amp;rsquo;re not finished yet. We haven&amp;rsquo;t considered how we should study over very short periods of time. (_10_) . Should you look at the same word in rapid succession, or look at the word and then have some delay before you look at it again (_11_)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp; Every year in the first week of my English class, some students inform me that writhing is too hard. They never write, unless assignments (_1_) it . They fine the writing process (_2_) and difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How awful to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it- (_3_) English , with its rich vocabulary . Being able to speak but not write is like living in an&amp;nbsp;(_4_) mansion(豪宅) and never leaving one small room . When I meet students who think they can&amp;rsquo;t write, I know as a teacher my&amp;nbsp;(_5_)&amp;nbsp; is to show them the rest of the rooms . My task is to build fluency while providing the opportunity inherent in any writing activity to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_6_) the moral and emotional development of my students . One great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Writing ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_7_) , just like exercise ; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise , writing skills improve quickly with writing practice. I often see a rise in student confidence and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_8_) after only a few weeks of journal writing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Expressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole student. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_9_) lives . They build skills so that some day they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation, or the perfect love letter. Every day that they write in their journals puts them a step&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_)&amp;nbsp; to fluency , eloquence (雄辩), and command of language .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The January fashion show, called FutureFashion , exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to fine . &amp;ldquo;Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren&amp;rsquo;t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and shat your customers are used to,&amp;rdquo; he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco- friendly equivalents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers &amp;amp; Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs(企业家) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable . It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional(过渡型的) cotton at higher prices , thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material . &amp;ldquo;Mainstream is about to occur,&amp;rdquo; says Hahn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some analysts(分析师) are less sure . Among consumers, only 18%are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer, when asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: &amp;ldquo;Not that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of.&amp;rdquo; Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she&amp;rsquo;s on the hunt for &amp;ldquo;cute stuff that isn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive.&amp;rdquo; By her own admission, green just isn&amp;rsquo;t yet on her mind. But &amp;ndash;thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers &amp;ndash;one day it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair , a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re what you eat and drink, and that&amp;rsquo;s recorded in you hair,&amp;rdquo; said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as raid clouds move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable , but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (同位素) . The heaviest raid falls first .As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Cerling&amp;rsquo;s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a mop of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of raid systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not good for pinpointing (精确定位),&amp;rdquo; Cerling said . &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s good for eliminating many possibilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s still a substantial area,&amp;rdquo; Park said &amp;ldquo;But it narrows it way down for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
