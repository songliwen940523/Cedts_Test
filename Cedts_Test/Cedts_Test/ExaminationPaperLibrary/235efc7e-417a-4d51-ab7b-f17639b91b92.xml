        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        "Please pass the turkey and dressing." What does this simple request make you think about? If you are an American, you think about Thanksgiving. A turkey dinner symbolizes Thanksgiving for Americans. What does Thanksgiving remind Americans of? Their families. Thanksgiving is a family time. On this holiday, families gather to gobble up the gobbler and stuff themselves with stuffing. Family members enjoy watching parades and football games on TV and just being together. What does "family" mean to Americans? &lt;br/&gt;        The traditional American family is a "nuclear family." A nuclear family refers to a husband and wife and their children. The average American family today has two or three children (and maybe a few pets). In some cultures, people live close to their extended family. Several generations may even live together. In America, only in a few cases does more than one household live under one roof. &lt;br/&gt;        American values receive a warm welcome in the home. Many homes are run like a democracy. Each family member can have a say. A sense of equality often exists in American homes. Instead of fearing Mom and Dad, children may think of them as good friends. Husbands and wives often share household chores. In many cases, a child can enjoy privacy in his or her own bedroom. From an early age, children gain responsibility in handling money. They may receive a weekly allowance or even work part-time jobs. Often parents give children freedom to make their own decisions. Preschoolers choose what clothes to wear or which toys to buy. Young adults generally make their own choices about what career to pursue and whom to marry. &lt;br/&gt;        Families in America, like those in every culture, face many problems. Social pressures are breaking apart more and more American homes. Over half of U.S. marriages now end in divorce. More than one in four American children are growing up in single-parent homes. As a result, many people believe the American family is in trouble. &lt;br/&gt;        Even so, there is still reason for hope. Many organizations are working hard to strengthen families. Americans almost unanimously believe that the family is one of the most important parts of life. The vast majority also feel that the traditional two-parent family is best for children. They realize that problems in family life in recent years have brought about serious consequences. As a result, more and more people are making their family a priority. &lt;br/&gt;        Many women are quitting their jobs to stay home with their children. Families are going on vacations and outings together. Husbands and wives are making a concentrated effort to keep their marriages solid. &lt;br/&gt;        The United Nations has declared 1994 the "International Year of the Family". Not just in America, but all over the world, people recognize the importance of strong families. How do you strengthen the family bond? Do special things for each other. Talk to each other. Play together. Spend time together. Oh, and one more thing: be thankful for each other. If you have a family, every day should be Thanksgiving.</Content>

        <Script>M: Hi, haven't seen you for ages!
W: Oh, hi! I've been studying a lot for my final exams.
M: Well, the semester is almost over now.
W: Yeah. My sister is coming for a visit this summer, and we'd like to see some of the country. But traveling is so expensive.
M: Have you thought about camping?
W: Camping? I've never done that before.
M: Oh, I think you'll really like it. You can rent the equipment you need. It's much cheaper than buying it or staying at a hotel. And being close to nature is a good way to forget about our busy school life for a while.
W: What a good idea! We can drive until we find a nice place and just camp wherever we like.
M: Well, not exactly. It's usually illegal unless you camp in a designated area. But there are many national parks, state parks and even privately owned camping grounds around the country.
W: But that takes all the fun out of it.
M: Not really. It's a good way to make new friends. Besides, there are almost always showers at the camping grounds.
W: Sounds great! I'll talk to you about this later and get all the details.</Script>

        <Script>W: So, what did you do today?
M: Well, I got up quite early this morning, actually, to go shopping.
W: Oh, yeah! Oh, shopping.
M: I really like shopping.
W: That's true but you're on a budget. You're trying to save money.
M: I know, but it is my brother's birthday in a week or so.
W: Oh, no kidding.
M: Yeah.
W: So, what did you get your brother for his birthday?
M: Well, it was quite difficult to find something that I thought he would like, but I got him some cakes in the end, some Japanese cakes.
W: Japanese cakes?
M: Yeah, they're in a special presentation box.
W: So, how are you going to get the cakes to your brother? Just through the post office?
M: Yes, I sent them in the post this morning.
W: Oh, did you send them by express or just regular mail?
M: Regular mail because it was cheaper.
W: But, don't you want it to hurry and get there for his birthday?
M: I've got one week. I think it will get there in time.
W: So, what do you think you're brother will think of the cakes?
M: I don't think he'll like them actually.
W: No?
M: Well, he likes chocolate cake, and they look like they've got kind of chocolate inside but it's bean paste. I think he'll be disappointed.
W: So what did your brother get you for your last birthday?
M: That's a good question. He always gives me money, and he often gives me chocolate as well. He's very generous.
W: Actually, I'm the same way. Guys like to give money. Money is so easy. No shopping involved.
M: It's practical, though, it's good.
W: Incidentally, is this a younger brother or older brother?
M: He's older. He's twenty-six.
W: Oh, he's twenty six.
M: He's going to be twenty-six soon.
W: Ok, well, if you happen to e-mail him, tell him happy birthday.
M: Oh, I certainly will do. Thanks.</Script>

          </question>
        </Questions>
        <Script>Domestic pets cause most animal bites. Dogs are more likely to bite than cats. Cat bites, however, are more likely to cause infection. Bites from nonimmunized domestic animals and wild animals carry the risk of rabies. Rabies is more common in raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes than in cats and dogs. Rabbits, squirrels and other rodents rarely carry rabies. If an animal bites you or your child, follow these guidelines:
&lt;b&gt;For minor wounds.&lt;/b&gt; If the bite barely breaks the skin and there is no danger of rabies, treat it as a minor wound. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic cream to prevent infection and cover the bite with a clean bandage. 
&lt;b&gt;For deep wounds.&lt;/b&gt; If the animal bite creates a deep puncture of the skin or the skin is badly torn and bleeding, apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding and see your doctor. 
&lt;b&gt;For infection.&lt;/b&gt; If you notice signs of infection such as swelling, redness, increased pain or oozing, see your doctor immediately. 
&lt;b&gt;For suspected rabies.&lt;/b&gt; If you suspect the bite was caused by an animal that might carry rabies - any bite from a wild or domestic animal of unknown immunization status - see your doctor immediately. Doctors recommend getting a tetanus shot every 10 years. If your last one was more than five years ago and your wound is deep or dirty, your doctor may recommend a booster. You should have the booster within 48 hours of the injury.</Script>

        <Script>Every animal is a living radiator --- heat formed in its cells is given off through its skin. Warm-blooded animals maintain a temperature by constantly replacing lost surface heat; smaller animals, which have more skin for every ounce of body weight, must produce heat faster than bigger ones. Because smaller animals burn fuel faster, scientists say they live faster. 

The speed at which an animal lives is determined by measuring the rate at which it uses oxygen. A chicken, for example, uses one-half cubic centimeter of oxygen every hour for each gram it weighs. The tiny shrew uses four cubic centimeters of oxygen every hour for each gram it weighs. Because it uses oxygen eight times as fast, it is said that the mouselike shrew is living eight times as fast as the chicken. The smallest of the warm-blooded creatures, the humming-bird, lives a hundred times as fast as an elephant. 

There is limit to how small a warm-blooded animal can be. A mammal or bird that weighed only two and a half grams would starve to death. It would burn up its food too rapidly and would not be able to eat fast enough to supply more fuel.</Script>

        <Script>Is teaching important? Well, of course it is. There was a time when the necessary knowledge could be taught to the young by family members. But as societies became more complex and division of labor more common, it was impossible for family members to teach the information and skills young people needed to become useful members of the society. As the need for specialists appeared, the job of teaching came into being in our country, and teaching as a job has been of increasing importance over the past one hundred years. Today, we have strict rules for teachers. We hope all children can go to school. Many things tell us that teaching is indeed an "important" job. In recent years, there has been an increasing need for teachers to be "responsible". This means that the public expects teachers to succeed in teaching important information to the young. Teachers' salaries today, while not much, certainly are much higher than they were in the past. These increases have come about because people have realized that without enough salaries, people who have abilities will not become teachers. Today almost no one says that "anybody will do" for a teacher. The public expects "quality people" to teach the young, and progress is being made to give salaries that will make people who have abilities become teachers.</Script>

        <Content>        Hi. My name is Dina. I'm a black Canadian. When I was two-and-a-half years old I was adopted (收养) by a white couple who already had two biological sons. I am grateful for my parents and two brothers but growing up was sometimes difficult.&lt;br/&gt;        Nearly everyone living in our neighborhood was white. Children sometimes teased (逗笑) me and &lt;u&gt;called me names&lt;/u&gt; because I was black...because I was different... and because I didn't know who my biological parents were.&lt;br/&gt;        Adults could also be cruel. Sometimes they would refuse to acknowledge my parents as my real parents. It was difficult to understand such an attitude but as I grew older I began to realize that they simply didn't understand that my parents had CHOSEN to raise me. I also realized that being an adopted child didn't make my own family less real or less valuable.&lt;br/&gt;        Now that I am older, I can see that I was lucky to be adopted. In North America, most couples who adopt children want newborn babies. When a child is older than two or three, it becomes more difficult for him or her to be adopted.&lt;br/&gt;        Children who cannot find parents to adopt them are placed in foster (收养) homes. Foster children do not become legal members of the family and may live with several different families while they are growing up.&lt;br/&gt;        Fortunately this didn't happen to me. As an adopted child, I grew up as part of a family and with the same security as a child born to the family. My parents are my parents and my brothers are my brothers. I can't imagine calling anyone else "mother" and "father" or "brother". "Adoption" is a word for outsiders.</Content>

        <Content>        If you can’t see the point of the structure of the back wheel on a bicycle, try riding a unicycle or watch an ant colony. Ants have realized that, to carry a heavy load, two supports are better than one — even if they seem quite mismatched.&lt;br/&gt;        When army ants want to carry a piece of food too big for a single ant to transport, an unusually large worker ant takes the front, and an unusually small one, the back. Two such ants can carry a load heavier than the sum of their individual abilities.&lt;br/&gt;        An ant pair is like a bicycle wheel. The small rear shifts the center of gravity between the two ends, making the whole system much more stable.&lt;br/&gt;        This is another example of how social insects rely on the colony to pass on genes that drive them to evolve sophisticated cooperation. Teamwork makes the most of the colony’s workforce.&lt;br/&gt;        How big and little ants team up is a mystery. Army ant lines move at a constant rate; an ant struggling with a piece of meat bigger than it can manage might attract helpers by causing traffic congestion. And the alliances aren’t permanent. They break up and do something else rather than go around together looking for another piece of food equally well suited to their capabilities as a couple.</Content>
