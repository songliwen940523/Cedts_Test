Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. &amp;ldquo;I just can&amp;rsquo;t get started&amp;rdquo; people say. But it&amp;rsquo;s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.&lt;br/&gt;	What you&amp;rsquo;re seeking is not physical energy. It&amp;rsquo;s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.&lt;br/&gt;	And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circum stances of their lives. Eyen as a child observed people who were poor or disabled or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of be to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.&lt;br/&gt;	Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or up bringing. So how do you get it? You can&amp;rsquo;t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.&lt;br/&gt;	1.Do something new.&lt;br/&gt;	Very little that&amp;rsquo;s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It&amp;#39;s like a tire with a slow leak. You don&amp;#39;t it at first, but eventually you&amp;#39;ll get a flat. It&amp;#39;s up to you to plug the leak--even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That&amp;#39;s where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.&lt;br/&gt;	Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline--a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.&lt;br/&gt;	Here&amp;#39;s a challenge: If it&amp;#39;s something you wouldn&amp;#39;t ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you&amp;#39;ve never eaten. Listen to music you&amp;#39;d ordinarily tune out. You&amp;#39;ll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.&lt;br/&gt;	2.Reclaim life&amp;#39;s meaning.&lt;br/&gt;	So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went state.&lt;br/&gt;	The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. &amp;quot;I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something.&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life.&amp;quot; Ivy&amp;#39;s solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.&lt;br/&gt;	3.Put yourself in the fun zone.&lt;br/&gt;	Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. &amp;quot;I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like withy a little tender loving care,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a challenge--and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;	We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.&lt;br/&gt;	4.Bid farewell to guilt and regret.&lt;br/&gt;	Everyone&amp;#39;s past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from us from moving forward. While they can&amp;#39;t merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.&lt;br/&gt;	5.Make up your mind.&lt;br/&gt;	Say you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish &amp;ndash; or too extreme?&lt;br/&gt;	You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.&lt;br/&gt;	Every time you can&amp;rsquo;t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don&amp;rsquo;t look back.&lt;br/&gt;	6.Give to get.&lt;br/&gt;	Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter., You have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.&lt;br/&gt;	Start by asking everyone you meet, &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo; as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don&amp;rsquo;t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you&amp;rsquo;re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person&amp;mdash;and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (按摩) to someone you love, or cook her dinner, Then, expand the circle to work. Try asking yourself what you&amp;rsquo;d do if your goal were to be helpful rather than efficient.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;After all, if it&amp;rsquo;s true that what goes around comes around, why not make sure that what&amp;rsquo;s circulating around you is the good stuff?&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Directions: In this part, you will have 15 minute to go over the passage quickly and answer the questions on Answer Sheet 1.&lt;br/&gt;	For questions 1-7, mark&lt;br/&gt;	Y (for YES) if the statement agrees with the information given in the passage;&lt;br/&gt;	N (for NO) if statement contradicts the information given in the passage;&lt;br/&gt;	NG (for NOT GIVEN) if the information is not given in the passage.&lt;br/&gt;	For question 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.&lt;br/&gt;	Highways&lt;br/&gt;	Early in the 20th century, most of the streets and roads in the U.S. were made of dirt, brick, and cedar wood blocks. Built for horse, carriage, and foot traffic, they were usually poorly cared for and too narrow to accommodate (容纳) automobiles.&lt;br/&gt;	With the increase in auto production, private turnpike (收费公路) companies under local authorities began to spring up, and by 1921 there were 387,000 miles of paved roads. Many were built using specifications of 19th century Scottish engineers Thomas Telford and John MacAdam (for whom the macadam surface is named), whose specifications stressed the importance of adequate drainage. Beyond that, there were no national standards for size, weight restrictions, or commercial signs. During World War I, roads throughout the country were nearly destroyed by the weight of trucks. When General Eisenhower returned from Germany in 1919, after serving in the U.S. army&amp;rsquo;s first transcontinental motor convoy (车队), he noted: &amp;ldquo;The old convoy had started me thinking about good, two-lane highways, but Germany&amp;rsquo;s Autobahn or motorway had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons across the land.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	It would take another war before the federal government would act on a national highway system. During World War II, a tremendous increase in trucks and new roads were required. The war demonstrated how critical highways were to the defense effort. Thirteen per cent of defense plants received all their supplies by truck, and almost all other plants shipped more than half of their products by vehicle. The war also revealed that local control of highways had led to a confusing variety of design standards. Even federal and state highways did not follow basic standards. Some states allowed trucks up to 36,000 pounds, while others restricted anything over 7,000 pounds.&lt;br/&gt;	A government study recommended a national highway system of 33,920 miles, and congress soon passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which called for strict, centrally controlled design criteria.&lt;br/&gt;	The interstate highway system was finally launched in 1956 and has been hailed as one of the greatest public works projects of the century. To build its 44,000-mile web of highways, bridge, and tunnels, hundreds of unique engineering designs and solutions had to be worked out. Consider the many geographic features of the country: mountains, steep grades, wetlands, rivers, deserts and plains. Variables included the slope of the land, the ability of the pavement to support the load, the intensity of road use, and the nature of the underlying soil. Urban areas were another problem. Innovative designs of roadways, tunnels, bridges, overpasses, and interchanges that could run through or bypass urban areas soon began to weave their way across the country, forever altering the face of America.&lt;br/&gt;	Today, the interstate system links every major city in the U.S., and the U.S. with Canada and Mexico. Built with safety in mind, the highways have wide lanes and shoulders, dividing medians, or barriers, long entry and exit lanes, curves engineered for safe turns, and limited access. The death rate on highways is half that of all other U.S. roads (0.86 deaths per 100 million passenger miles compared to 1.99 deaths per 100 million on all other roads).&lt;br/&gt;	By opening the North American continent, highways have enabled consumer goods and services to reach people in remote and rural areas of the country, spurred the growth of suburbs, and provided people with greater options in term of jobs, access to cultural programs, health care, and other benefits. Above all, the interstate system provides individuals with what they cherish most: personal freedom of mobility.&lt;br/&gt;	The interstate system has been an essential element of the nation&amp;rsquo;s economic growth in terms of shipping and job creation: more than 75 percent of the nation&amp;rsquo;s freight deliveries arrive by truck; and most products that arrive by rail or air use interstates for the last leg of the journey by vehicle. Not only has the highway system affected the American economy by providing shipping routes, it has led to the growth of spin-off industries like service stations, motels, restaurants, and shopping centers. It has allowed the relocation of manufacturing plants and other industries from urban areas to rural.&lt;br/&gt;	By the end of the century there was an immense network of paved roads, residential streets, expressways, and freeways built to support millions of vehicles. The highway system was officially renamed for Eisenhower to honor his vision and leadership. The year construction began he said: &amp;ldquo;Together, the united forces of our communication and transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we bear&amp;mdash;United States. Without them, we would be a mere alliance of many separate parts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	That&amp;rsquo;s enough, kids&lt;br/&gt;	It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he&amp;rsquo;d shoved,&amp;rdquo; she says.&amp;rdquo; I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, &amp;rsquo;No, we don&amp;rsquo;t push,&amp;rdquo; What happened next was unexpected.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;The boy&amp;rsquo;s mother ran toward me from across the park,&amp;rdquo; Stella says,&amp;rdquo; I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for disciplining her child, All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted, hurting other children in the process?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people&amp;rsquo;s children has become a minefield.&lt;br/&gt;	In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister&amp;rsquo;s house it&amp;rsquo;s encouraged. For her, it&amp;rsquo;s about kids being kids:&amp;rdquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t do it at three, when can you do it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Each of these philosophies is valid and, it has to be said, my son loves visiting his aunt&amp;rsquo;s house. But I find myself saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; a lot when her kids are over at mine. That&amp;rsquo;s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous territory when you&amp;rsquo;re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Kids aren&amp;rsquo;t all raised the same,&amp;rdquo; agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University.&amp;rdquo; But there is still an idea that they&amp;rsquo;re the property of the parent. We see our children as an extension of ourselves, so if you&amp;rsquo;re saying that my child is behaving inappropriately, then that&amp;rsquo;s somehow a criticism of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	In those circumstances, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two schools of thought.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d go to the child first,&amp;rdquo; says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. Usually a quiet reminder that &amp;rsquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t do that here&amp;rsquo; is enough. Kids nave finely tuned antennae (直觉) for how to behave in different settings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel neglectful, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.&lt;br/&gt;	This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents if they&amp;rsquo;re there and ask them to deal with it,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;br/&gt;	Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers:&amp;rdquo;Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Preface your remarks with something like: &amp;rsquo;I know you&amp;rsquo;ll think I&amp;rsquo;m silly but in my house I don&amp;rsquo;t want&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	When it comes to situations where you&amp;rsquo;re caring for another child, white is straightforward: &amp;ldquo;common sense must prevail. If things don&amp;rsquo;t go well, then have a chat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	There&amp;rsquo;re a couple of new grey areas. Physical punishment, once accepted from any adult, is no longer appropriate. &amp;ldquo;A new set of considerations has come to the fore as part of the debate about how we handle children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	For Andrew Fuller, the child-centric nature of our society has affected everyone:&amp;rdquo; The rules are different now from when today&amp;rsquo;s parents were growing up,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;Adults are scared of saying: &amp;rsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t swear&amp;rsquo;, or asking a child to stand up on a bus. They&amp;rsquo;re worried that there will be conflict if they point these things out &amp;ndash; either from older children, or their parents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	He sees it as a loss of the sense of common public good and public courtesy (礼貌), and says that adults suffer form it as much as child.&lt;br/&gt;	Meredith Fuller agrees: &amp;ldquo;A code of conduct is hard to create when you&amp;rsquo;re living in a world in which everyone is exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, and a world in which nice people are perceived to finish last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and what I need,&amp;rdquo; Andrew Fuller says. &amp;rdquo;The days when a kid came home from school and said, &amp;ldquo;I got into trouble&amp;rdquo;. And dad said, &amp;lsquo;you probably deserved it&amp;rsquo;, are over. Now the parents are charging up to the school to have a go at teachers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	This jumping to our children&amp;rsquo;s defense is part of what fuels the &amp;ldquo;walking on eggshells&amp;rdquo; feeling that surrounds our dealings with other people&amp;rsquo;s children. You know that if you remonstrate(劝诫) with the child, you&amp;#39;re going to have to deal with the parent. It&amp;rsquo;s admirable to be protective of our kids, but is it good?&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Children have to learn to negotiate the world on their own, within reasonable boundaries,&amp;rdquo; White says. &amp;ldquo;I suspect that it&amp;rsquo;s only certain sectors of the population doing the running to the school &amp;ndash;better &amp;ndash;educated parents are probably more likely to be too involved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	White believes our notions of a more child-centred, it&amp;#39;s a way of talking about treating our children like commodities(商品). We&amp;rsquo;re centred on them but in ways that reflect positively on us. We treat them as objects whose appearance and achievements are something we can be proud of, rather than serve the best interests of the children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	One way over-worked, under-resourced parents show commitment to their children is to leap to their defence. Back at the park, Bianchi&amp;#39;s intervention(干预) on her son&amp;#39;s behalf ended in an undignified exchange of insulting words with the other boy&amp;#39;s mother.&lt;br/&gt;	As Bianchi approached the park bench where she&amp;rsquo;d been sitting, other mums came up to her and congratulated her on taking a stand. &amp;ldquo;Apparently the boy had a longstanding reputation for bad behaviour and his mum for even worse behaviour if he was challenged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Andrew Fuller doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe that we should be afraid of dealing with other people&amp;rsquo;s kids. &amp;ldquo;Look at kids that aren&amp;rsquo;t your own as a potential minefield,&amp;rdquo; he says. He recommends that we don&amp;rsquo;t stay silent over inappropriate behaviour, particularly with regular visitors.&lt;br/&gt;	注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	A Grassroots Remedy&lt;br/&gt;	　　Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers (慢跑者) jog, they don&amp;rsquo;t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.&lt;br/&gt;	　　But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, South London. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.&lt;br/&gt;	　　The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD&amp;mdash;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.&lt;br/&gt;	　　A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy (等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Most bullying (恃强凌弱) is found in schools where there is a tarmac (柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;	　　But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.&lt;br/&gt;	　　One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.&lt;br/&gt;	　　The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.&lt;br/&gt;	　　In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, &amp;ldquo;A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour.&amp;rdquo; Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.&lt;br/&gt;	　　We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Human beings are a species of mammals (哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.&lt;br/&gt;	　　We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Five ways to find harmony with the natural world&lt;br/&gt;	　　Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that&amp;rsquo;s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home. It lasts forever, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid*&lt;br/&gt;	Good grades and high test scores still matter&amp;mdash;a lot&amp;mdash;to many colleges as they award financial aid.&lt;br/&gt;	But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examing whether that aid, typically known as &amp;ldquo;merit aid&amp;rdquo;, is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars.&lt;br/&gt;	George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients (接受者), pouring the savings, about $2.5million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.&lt;br/&gt;	Now, Hamilton College in Clinton. N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.&lt;br/&gt;	Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don&amp;rsquo;t meet need eligibility (资格) have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.&lt;br/&gt;	For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above scholarship amount to keep the institution running.&lt;br/&gt;	But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profiles. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re trying to buy students,&amp;rdquo; says Skidmore Colllege economist Sandy Baum.&lt;br/&gt;	Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,&amp;rdquo; says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News &amp;amp; World Report&amp;rsquo;s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.&lt;br/&gt;	Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $1 million a year, &amp;ldquo;served us well,&amp;rdquo; Inzer says, but &amp;ldquo;to be discounting the price for families that don&amp;rsquo;t need financial aid doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right any more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.&lt;br/&gt;	Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state&amp;rsquo;s public institutions.&lt;br/&gt;	But in recent years, a growing chorus (异口同声) of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be &amp;ldquo;a sign that people are starting to realize that there&amp;rsquo;s this destructive competition going on.&amp;rdquo; says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.&lt;br/&gt;	David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;No one can take one-sided action,&amp;rdquo; says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption (豁免) from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid. &amp;ldquo;This is a merry-go-round that&amp;rsquo;s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don&amp;rsquo;t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.&lt;br/&gt;	That is one reason Allegheny College doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan to drop merit aid entirely.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,&amp;rdquo; says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny&amp;rsquo;s vice president for enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;	Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment (捐赠), meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re playing the merit game,&amp;rdquo; acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong points, too, he says, &amp;ldquo;The fact of the matter is, it&amp;rsquo;s not just about the lowest-income people. It&amp;rsquo;s the average American middle-class family who&amp;rsquo;s being priced out of the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	*A few words about merit-based aid:&lt;br/&gt;	Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;	Academic merit scholarships are based on students&amp;rsquo; grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a tearcher as part of the qualification process.&lt;br/&gt;	Athletic merit scholarships are meant for student that excel (突出) in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee (裁判). Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance.&lt;br/&gt;	Artistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio （选辑） of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Rushmoore National Monument&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        The well-known Rushmoore National Monument in the United States is erected （使竖立） on the Rushmoore Peak, 1829 meters above sea level, of the Black Hills in the south — west of South Dakota. It is a group of huge stone statues of four American presidents, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Licoln and Theodore Roosevelt. President Washington is the founding father of the country; the 3rd President Jefferson drafted the U．S．Declaration of Independence; the 16th President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation （独立宣言） and the 26th President Roosevelt protected the average people's right to compete fairly with trusts. All the four presidents made outstanding achievements for their country. They were pioneers of U.S. history.&lt;br/&gt;        The stone statues of presidents were built at the suggestion of an historian in the State of Dakota, with a view to carrying forward the U.S. pioneering spirit everlastingly. The famed artist Gutzon Borglum, a naturalized Danish-American, made the design and was in charge of the project of historic significance. It was the 30th President Calvin Coolidge who announced in 1927 the start of the stone work. But before the work done, the sculptor passed away when he was 73 years of age. He was then succeeded by his son, and it was not until 1941 that the National Monument was put up.&lt;br/&gt;        As the stone statues were rather enormous, technology of directional blasting was resorted to in the main. Explosives were used to blow up the peak into models first, and then the stonemasons carved them into statues with tools. The broken stones weighed about four hundred fifty thousand tons in total. This project was the fruit of arduous （辛勤的） work done by a contingent of 360 odd masons （石工） in as long as 14 years. A sum of one million dollar was expended.&lt;br/&gt;        The statues are 18 meters high. They are the highest and greatest realistic stone statues in the world, taller than a 6-storied building and larger than the Great Sphinx of Egypt. The size of each head is 20 sq mt, with a 20-meter long face, a 7-meter long nose, a 2.6-meter wide mouth and two 1.5-meter wide eyes. Though not facing the same direction, they are all lifelike and look ahead gravely in harmony with fixed gazes. On clear days,one can have a sight of the four presidents with their firm and steady expression at a distance of dozens of kilometers. &lt;br/&gt;        Since the stone sculpture is unique in style, the Monument is now the U．S．National Art Centre of Popular Education. Groups of people keep streaming everyday to the site for a visit and tourists across the world are also interested in taking a view of this colossal （庞大的） Monument.</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	How Do You See Diversity?&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company .During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said &amp;ldquo;untrustworthy,&amp;rdquo; so she decided to offer the job to her second choice.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person,&amp;rdquo; Tiffany confesses. What she hadn&amp;rsquo;t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo; behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding . He was an Asian-American raised in a household where respect for those in authority was shown by averting(避开) your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I was just thrown off by the lack of ye contact; not realizing it was cultural,&amp;rdquo; Tiffany says. &amp;ldquo;I missed out ,but will not miss that opportunity again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;Many of us have had similar encounters with behaviors we perceive as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our under-standing of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions .&lt;br/&gt;	Hire Advantage&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult ,employers who can eliminate invalid biases(偏爱) from the process have a distinct advantage .My company, Mindsets LLC ,helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots . A real estate recruiter we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;During my Mindsets coaching session ,I was taught how to recruit a diversified workforce. I recruited people from different cultures and skill sets .The agents were able to utilize their full potential and experiences to build up the company .When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Blinded by Gender&lt;br/&gt;	Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops on supervising a diverse workforce . &amp;ldquo;Through one of the sessions ,I discovered my personal bias ,&amp;rdquo; he recalls . &amp;ldquo;I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person , and being open to differences .&amp;rdquo; In his case , the blindness was not about culture but rather gender .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I had a management position open in my department ;and the two finalists were a man and a woman . Had I not attended this workshop , I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel . My reasoning would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position , I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel .&amp;rdquo;Dale&amp;rsquo;s assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases into the situation , I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision .&amp;rdquo; Dale credits the workshop , &amp;ldquo;because it helped me make decisions based on fairness .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Year of the Know-It-All&lt;br/&gt;	Doug is another supervisor who attended one of my workshops .He recalls a major lesson learned from his own employee.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;One of my most embarrassing moments was when I had a Chinese-American employee put in a request to take time off to celebrate Chinese New Year . In my ignorance , I assumed he had his dates wrong , as the first of January had just passed . When I advised him of this , I gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;He patiently waited , then when I was done , he said he would like Chinese New Year did not begin January first , and that Chinese New Year ,which is tied to the lunar cycle ,is one of the most celebrated holidays on the Chinese calendar . Needless to say , I felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up . But I learned a great deal about assumptions , and that the timing of holidays varies considerably from culture to culture .&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Attending the diversity workshop helped me realize how much I could learn by simply asking questions and creating dialogues with my employees , rather than making assumptions and trying to be a know-it-all ,&amp;rdquo; Doug admits . &amp;ldquo;The biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more &amp;lsquo;inclusive&amp;rsquo; to differences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	A better Bottom Line&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations internally , it is profitable as well . These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales .&amp;rdquo;Most of my customers speak English as a second language . One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone . It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until my boss received Mindsets&amp;rsquo; training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service . As result , our customer base has increased .&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Once we start to see people as individuals . and discard the stereotypes , we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone . Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities . It is about building better communities and organizations that enhance us as individuals and reinforce our shared humanity .&lt;br/&gt;	When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers , family , friends , etc , we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are flawed(有缺陷的) or contrary to our fundamental values . We need to train our-selves to think differently , shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us ,creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;b&gt;From Trash to Treasure&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Early on a Saturday morning, much of the world remains in bed, enjoying an extra hour or two of sleep. But a few Americans are up and preparing for the hunt. Armed with the newspaper yard-sale listings, they plan to be the first to arrive at the sales. What are these yard-sale shoppers hunting for? Secondhand treasures, of course!&lt;br/&gt;        Yard-sale shoppers aren't the only people who like used goods. From Australia to U.S.A., Westerners love to buy other people's stuff. Even the wealthy willingly search through used goods looking for a unique treasure.&lt;br/&gt;        Some people buy used goods simply to save money. Others hunt through them hoping to find a valuable antique. Still others look for items to add to their collections. &lt;br/&gt;        Some items remind people of childhood. A flour tin from the 1940s may bring back memories of Mom's homemade cookies. A copy of a favorite children's book can remind someone of bedtime stories with Dad. &lt;br/&gt;        True antique must be at least 100 years old. But any item that is no longer made can be a collectible and some hold great value.&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Old is Old?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        For those in Asia, where 5,000-year-old vases sit in museums, Western antiques don't seem too old. But for Americans, items even a few decades old have value. An ice-cream maker from the 1920s could be worth US$50. A sign from World War I could sell for US$4,000 or more. &lt;br/&gt;        Some who collect want to make money and become antique dealers. They carefully look over items for any flaws （瑕疵） that would lower the item's value. They take classes and read books to learn which items will increase in value or are desirable to collectors. &lt;br/&gt;        Others simply buy whatever catches their fancy. If people enjoy rock 'n' roll music, they might collect old records. A tea drinker may collect antique teacups. Those not looking to make money suggest, "Don't buy it unless it's useful."&lt;br/&gt;        The trick is finding new ways to use old items. For example, an old-fashioned clothes iron may be used as a bookend. An old children's toy wagon could display books or teddy bears in a guest room. An antique quilt could be hung on the wall for display. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to Find Collectibles&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Secondhand goods can be found in all sorts of places. Saturday morning yard sales are just the beginning. Flea markets are another hot spot for collectibles. You won't find bugs, but you may find yard tools, arts and crafts, and furniture.&lt;br/&gt;        Shopping at a flea market for the first time can be overwhelming. Tables piled high with junk fill large rooms or outdoor markets. And you have to look through it all yourself to find anything worth taking home. For antique lovers, however, finding just the right treasure makes all that looking worthwhile. &lt;br/&gt;        More valuable pieces are typically found in antique auctions. You can find them in cities or online. In today's world of technology, someone in California can buy a mirror from a shop in Maine without leaving home. &lt;br/&gt;        You don't have to spend money to enjoy secondhand shopping. An afternoon wandering antique shops and flea markets can be a mini history lesson. Old movie posters may catch your eye, or an old piano. Each piece brings the past to life. You never knew what treasures you're going to find in someone else's trash.</Content>

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; W: Hey, Bob, guess what? I&amp;rsquo;m going to visit Quebec next summer. I&amp;rsquo;m invited to go to a friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　But while I&amp;rsquo;m there I&amp;rsquo;d also like to do some sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: That&amp;rsquo;s nice, Shelly. But do you mean the province of Quebec, or Quebec City?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: I mean the province. My friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding is in Montreal. I&amp;rsquo;m going there first. I&amp;rsquo;ll stay for five days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Well, Many people think so because it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest city. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the capital. Quebec City is. But Montreal is great. The Saint Royal River runs right through the middle of the city. It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful in summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is OK, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Well, People speak both French and English there. But you&amp;rsquo;ll hear French most of the time. And all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French speaking city in the world. So you&amp;rsquo;d better practice your French before you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Good advice. What about Quebec City? I&amp;rsquo;ll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What&amp;rsquo;s it like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th or 18th centuries. You&amp;rsquo;ll love there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Fantastic. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go.&lt;/p&gt;

	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;M: Hi, Miss Rowling, how old were you when you started to write? And what was your first book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: I wrote my first Finnish (finished) story when I was about six. It was about a small animal, a rabbit, I mean. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing ever since?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Why did you choose to be an author?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: If someone asked me how to achieve happiness. Step One would be finding out what you love doing most. Step two would be finding someone to pay you to do this. I consider myself very lucky indeed to be able to support myself by writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Do you have any plans to write books for adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: My first two novels were for adults. I suppose I might write another one. But I never really imagine a target audience when I&amp;rsquo;m writing. The ideas come first. So it really depends on the ideas that grasp me next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: where did the ideas for the &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; books come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　I&amp;rsquo;ve no ideas where the ideas came from. And I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll never find out. It would spoil my excitement if it turned out I just have a funny wrinkle on the surface of my brain, which makes me think about the invisible train platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: How did you come up with the names of your characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　I invented some of them. But I also collected strange names. I&amp;rsquo;ve got one from ancient saints, maps, dictionaries, plants, war memoirs and people I met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Oh, you are really resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;

	Conversation 2&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Hey, Karen, you are not really reading it, are you?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Pardon?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: The book! You haven&amp;rsquo;t turned the page in the last ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: No, Jim, I suppose I haven&amp;rsquo;t. I need to get through it, though, but I keep drifting away.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really hold your interest?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: No, not really. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bother with it, to be honest, but I have to read it for a seminar. I&amp;rsquo;m at a university.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: It&amp;rsquo;s a labor of labor then rather than a labor of love.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I should say, I don&amp;rsquo;t like Dickens at all really, the author, indeed, I am starting to like the whole course less and less.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: It&amp;rsquo;s not just the book,, it&amp;rsquo;s the curse as well?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yeah, in a way, although the curse itself isn&amp;rsquo;t really that bad, a lot of it is pretty good, in fact, and the lecturer is fine, as to me, I suppose, you see, I want to do philosophy rather than English, but my parents took me out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: So the courses are OK as such, it&amp;rsquo;s just that had if been left to you, you would choose a different one.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, they had my best interest and heart of course, my parents, they always do, don&amp;rsquo;t they? They believe that my job prospect would be pretty limited with the degree of philosophy. Plus, they give me a really generous allowance, but I am beginning to feel that I&amp;rsquo;m wasting my time and their money. They would be so disappointed though if I told them I was quitting.&lt;/p&gt;

	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; F: Simon, how does it feel to be retired?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: How have you been spending your time?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I have been spending more time with my family. I&amp;rsquo;ve also travelled a bit, you know, off season when everywhere is less crowded and hotels cost less.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: Great.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: You know I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped work completely.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: Yes, could you tell us more about this?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I&amp;rsquo;m on a scheme that&amp;rsquo;s called phased retirement; I had a six-month break from work, after that I could apply for project work with the company I used to work for.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: How does the scheme work?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a trial at the moment. Instead of hiring temporary stuff, the company advertises posts on its website that retired employees like myself can access.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: What sort of works advertised?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, all sorts of things, really. Administrative work and more specialized work, the sort of thing I can do. Some of the projects can last five or six months, and others can just be a couple of days. I can decide more or less when to work. So I can manage my own time.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: I can see it&amp;rsquo;s good for you. What is your company get out of this?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, I still have all my old contacts at work, so I know who to contact to get something done. The company gets flexibility, too. Once the job&amp;rsquo;s over, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;m not on their books any more.&lt;br /&gt;

	　　M: I want to show you something.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: I know, but what is it?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: A farm. It&amp;rsquo;s just down this road. It&amp;rsquo;s a small place, but at least it would be our own.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: A farm? How can we afford to buy a farm?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: It isn&amp;rsquo;t very large, only 40 acres. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay very much right now.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Is there a house on the place?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: A small one, two bedrooms, but it needs to be fixed up a little. I can do the job myself.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: OK. Is there enough space for a kitchen garden?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: There is about half an acre around the house. That&amp;rsquo;s plenty of space.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Then we can grow our own fresh vegetables. And maybe keep a few chickens, couldn&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Yes, and we can probably grow a lot of our own food.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: What are you thinking about growing, if we do take this place?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, it really isn&amp;rsquo;t big enough for corn. I thought we might try to raise a crop of potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Potatoes? There are a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: We are used to hard work, aren&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Yes, we are, but the money. Do we have enough to get started? It seems like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I think we&amp;rsquo;ve saved enough. We can pay a little on the farm and maybe put a few dollars down on the tractor, too.&lt;br /&gt;

	M: Mrs. Dawson, thanks very much for coming down to the station. I just like to go over some of the things that you told police officer Parmer at the bank.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: All right.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, could you describe the man who robbed the bank for this report that we&amp;rsquo;re filling out here? Now, anything at all that you can remember would be extremely helpful to us.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, just, I can only remember basically what I said before.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: That&amp;rsquo;s all right.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: The man was tall, six foot, and he had dark hair, and he had moustache.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Very good. All right, did he have any other distinguishing marks?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Um, no, none that I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Do you remember how old he was by any chance?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I guess around 30, maybe younger, give or take a few years.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Mm, all right. Do you remember anything about what he was wearing?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, yes, he had on a dark sweater, a solid color.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: OK. Um, anything else that strikes you at the moment?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I remember he was wearing a light shirt under the sweater. Yes, yes.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: All right. Mrs. Dawson, I really appreciate what you&amp;rsquo;ve been through today. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to ask you to look at some photographs before you leave if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind. It won&amp;rsquo;t take very long. Can you do that for me?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Would you like to step this way with me, please?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: OK, sure.&lt;br /&gt;

	M: Well, could you tell me your name?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Candidate Foreset.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh yes. What exactly is it that interests you about the job?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I thought it was just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Really? Um&amp;hellip; Could you tell me a little about yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes. I&amp;rsquo;m 23. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working abroad.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Where exactly have you been working?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: In Geneva.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh, Geneva. And what were you doing there?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Secretarial work. Previous to that, I was at university.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Which university was that?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: The University of Manchester. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a degree in English.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: You said you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in Geneva. Do you have any special reason for wanting to come back?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I thought it would be nice to be near to the family.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see, and how do you see yourself developing in this job?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I&amp;rsquo;m ambitious. I do hope that my career as a secretary will lead me eventually into management.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see. You have foreign languages?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: French and Italian.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, I think the best thing for you to do is do reply a writing to the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Can&amp;rsquo;t I arrange for an interview now?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid we must wait until all the applications are in, in writing, and then decide on the short list. If you are on the short list, of course we should see you.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, I see.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I look forward to receiving your application in writing in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;

          </question>
        </Questions>
        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; W: So, why exactly does your job have reputation for being stressful?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Stress is generally driven by the feeling of being out of control of a situation and the feeling of a situation controlling you. Trading in financial markets combines both.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: How do you relax in the evening?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I very rarely do anything work-related so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I had a bad day. I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away. To do something my brain will regard as creative.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Do you think what you do to relax is an effective way to beat stress?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find out what I do is effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Would you consider changing your job because of the high stress factor?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing. And if used the right way can actually be a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short medium and long term trading performance and success.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	W: Bob, do you know who I saw the other day? Old Jake, looking terribly depressed. Did he get pensioned off at last?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes. They made him retire after 50 years at sea. He is pretty upset about it, but what can you do? He really is pasted.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: He is all alone, isn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes, his wife has been dead for years. They had one daughter, Dories. But she went off to town as soon as she left school. And he hasn&amp;#39;t heard from her since. I hear she is making good money as a model.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Maybe someone could get in touch with her. Get her to come back for a while to help?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I don&amp;#39;t suppose she come. She never got on with her father. He is bit of a tough character and she is rather selfish. Oh, I expect old Jake will get by. He is healthy at least, comes into a clinic for a check regularly.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Are you his doctor?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: No, my partner doctor Johnson is.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: That bad-tempered old thing?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh, he isn&amp;#39;t bad-tempered. He just looks it. He is an excellent doctor, taught me a lot, and he has a very nice family. His wife invites me over there to supper every week. Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: yes. I teach their daughter Pen at school. She is a bit careless and lazy about her school work, but a bright little thing and very popular with her age group.&lt;br /&gt;

	W: Hello, Mr. Summerfield. How are you today?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Very well. Thank you, Ms. Green.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: What can I do for you?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, unfortunately, there is a problem with the order we received from you yesterday. It seems we haven&amp;#39;t seen the right quantity of manuals to support the telephone system.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, dear, that&amp;#39;s bad news. I&amp;#39;m very sorry to hear that, and you don&amp;#39;t know how many packs are without manuals?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: No, because we haven&amp;#39;t opened every pack. But in several of those that have been opened there are none, no manuals.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I&amp;#39;m very sorry about this inconvenience, Mr. Summerfield. We&amp;#39;ll send out the manuals this afternoon by express mail entirely at our cost, and the manuals should arrive tomorrow or the day after at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: All of them, right?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes. It maybe that some have them already, but we cannot be sure. So the best thing is to send out the manual for every pack.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Yes. Yes, I see. That would be great.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Please accept our apologies for this mix-up. I assure you we will do everything possible to find out why the mistake happened&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Right. Thanks for your swift action.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Not at all. Thank you and goodbye for now. Do call if there is anything else.&lt;br /&gt;

	Reducing the amount of sleep students get at night has a direct impact on their performance at school during the day. According to classroom teachers, elementary and middle school students who stay up late exhibit more learning and attention problems. This has been shown by Brown Medical School and Bradley Hospital research. In the study, teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received when completing weekly performance reports, yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less as having the most trouble recalling all the material，learning new lessons and completing high-quality work. Teachers also reported that these students had more difficulty paying attention. The experiment is the first to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children. Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well-functioning kids, said Garharn Forlone, the study&amp;rsquo;s lead author. So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message: when a child is having learning and attention problems, the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration. &amp;ldquo;If we don&amp;rsquo;t ask about sleep, and try to improve sleep patterns in kids&amp;rsquo; struggling academically, then we aren&amp;rsquo;t doing our job&amp;rdquo;, Forlone said. For parents, he said, the message is simple, &amp;ldquo;getting kids to bed on time is as important as getting them to school on time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Patricia Pena never wanted to be a public figure. All she wanted to be was a mother and home-maker. But her life was turned upside down when a motorist, distracted by his cell phone, ran a stop sign and crashed into the side of her car. The impact killed her 2-year-old daughter. Four months later, Pena reluctantly but courageously decided to try to educate the public and to fight for laws to ban drivers from using cell phones while a car is moving. She wanted to save other children from what happened to her daughter. In her first speech, Pena got off to a shaky start. She was visibly trembling and her voice was soft and uncertain. But as she got into her speech, a dramatic transformation took place. She stopped shaking and spoke with a strong voice. For the rest of her talk, she was a forceful and compelling speaker. She wanted everyone in the audience to know what she knew without having to learn it from a personal tragedy. Many in the audience were moved to tears and to action. In subsequent presentations, Pena gained reputation as a highly effective speaker. Her appearance on a talk show was broadcast three times, transmitting her message to over 40 million people. Her campaign increased public awareness of the problem, and prompted over 300 cities and several states to consider restrictions on cell phone use.&lt;/p&gt;

	Many people catch a cold in the spring time or fall. It makes us wonder if scientists can send a man to the moon, why can&amp;rsquo;t they find a cure for the common cold. The answer is easy. There&amp;rsquo;re actually hundreds of kinds of cold viruses out there. You never know which one you will get, so there isn&amp;rsquo;t a cure for each one. When a virus attacks your body, your body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and causes a blockade in it. You feel terrible because you can&amp;rsquo;t breathe well, but your body is actually eating the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting into your cells. You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold. Different people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and some other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot bath and drink warm liquids. Other people take medicines to relieve various symptoms of colds. There was one interesting thing to note. Some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you. The virus stays in you longer, because your body doesn&amp;rsquo;t develop a way to fight it and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

	Passage One&lt;br /&gt;
	In Greece, only rich people will rest in peace for ever when they die. Most of the population, however, will be undisturbed for only three years, then they will be dug up, washed, compressed into a small tin box, and placed in a bone room. If the body has only partially decayed, it is reburied in a smaller cheaper grave, but not for long, the body will be dug up again some time later when it has fully decayed. Buying a piece of land for a grave is the only way to avoid this process. The cost of the grave is so great that most p0eople choose to rent the grave for three years and even after it has been dug up, lasting peace is still not guaranteed. If no one pays for renting space in the bone room, the skeleton is removed and stored in a building in a poor part of the town. Lack of space in Athens is the main reason why the dead are dug up after the three years. The city is so overcrowded that sometimes dead bodies are kept in the hospitals for over a week until a grave is found. Athens&amp;rsquo; city council wants to introduce cremation, that is burning dead bodies as a means of dealing with the problems. But the Greek church resists this practice, they believe the only place where people burn is hell, so burning dead bodies is against the Greek concept of life after death. To save space, the church suggested burying the bodies standing up instead of lying down. Some people proposed building multi-storey underground grave yards.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage Two&lt;br /&gt;
	If you visit a big city anywhere in the world, you will probably find a restaurant would serve the food of your own native country. Most large cities in the United States offer international sample of foods. Many people enjoy eating the food of other nations. This is probably one reason why there are so many different kinds of restaurants in the United States. A second reason is that many Americans come from other part of the world. They enjoy tasting the foods of their native lands. In the city of Detroit, for example, there are many people from western Europe, Greece, Latin America, and the Far East. There are many restaurants in Detroit which serve the foods of these areas. There are many other international restaurants too. Americans enjoy the foods in these restaurants as well as the opportunity to better understand the people and their way of life. One of the most common international restaurants to be found in the United States is the Italian restaurant. The restaurant may be a small business run by a single family. The mother of the family cooks all of the dishes, and the father and children serve the people who come to eat there. Or it may be a large restaurant owned by several different people who worked together in the business. Many Italian dishes that Americans enjoy are made with meats, tomatoes and cheese, they are very delicious and tasty.&lt;br /&gt;

	Passage Three&lt;br /&gt;
	One winter day in 1891, a class at a training school in Massachusetts, U.S.A, went into the gym for their daily exercises. Since the football season had ended, most of the young man felt they were in for a boring time.&lt;br /&gt;
	But their teacher, James Nasmith had other ideas. He had been working for a long time on a new game that would have the excitement of the American football. Nasmith showed the men a basket he had hung at the each end of the gym, and explained that they were going to sue a round European football, at first everybody tried to throw the ball into the basket no matter where he was standing. &amp;ldquo;Pass! Pass!&amp;rdquo; Nasmith kept shouting, blowing his whistle to stop the excited players. Slowly, they began to understand what was wanted of them. The problem with the new game, which was soon called &amp;ldquo;basketball&amp;rdquo;, was getting the ball out of the basket. They used ordinary food baskets with bottoms and the ball, of course, stayed inside. At first, someone had to climb up every time a basket was scored. It was several years before someone came up with the idea of removing the bottom of the basket and letting the ball fall through. There have been many changes in the rules since then, and basketball has become one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular sports.&lt;br /&gt;

	Members of the city council and distinguished guests, it is my privilege to introduce to you today Mr. Robert&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Washington, chief of our city&amp;rsquo;s police force. He will address us on the subject of the Community Policing Program.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most of you know that Mr. Washington has a distinguished record as head of our police force for more than ten years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	However, you may not know that he also holds a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in criminology and studied abroad for a year with the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	international police force which deals with crimes around the world. Mr. Washington first introduced the Community&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Policing Program 8 years ago. The idea behind the program is to get the police officers out of their cars and into our&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	neighborhoods where they can talk directly to merchants and residents about the real dynamics of our city. These&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	officers do more than make arrests. They try to find ways to help solve the problems that contribute to crime in the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	first place. Often that means hooking people up with services offered by other city agencies, such as schools,&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	hospitals, housing, drug treatment centers. And the program seems to be working: crime is down and our citizens report&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	that they feel more secure. Today Mr. Washington is going to tell us more about this program. Now let&amp;rsquo;s welcome Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Robert Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	There are between 3000 and 6000 public languages in the world, and we must add approximately 6 billion private&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	languages since each one of us necessarily has one. Considering these facts, the possibilities for breakdowns in&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	communication seem infinite in number. However, we do communicate successfully from time to time. And we do learn to&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	speak languages. But learning to speak languages seems to be a very mysterious process. For a long time, people&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	thought that we learned a language only by imitation and association. For example, a baby touches a hot pot and starts&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	to cry. The mother says, &amp;ldquo;Hot, hot!&amp;rdquo; And the baby, when it stops crying, imitates the mother and says, &amp;ldquo;Hot, hot!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	However, Noam Chomsky, a famous expert in language, pointed out that although children do learn some words by&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	imitation and association, they also combine words to make meaningful sentences in ways that are unique, unlearned and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	creative. Because young children can make sentences they have never heard before, Chomsky suggested that human infants&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	are born with the ability to learn language. Chomsky meant that underneath all the differences between public and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	private languages, there is a universal language mechanism that makes it possible for us, as infants, to learn any&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	language in the world. This theory explains the potential that human infants have for learning language. But it does&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	not really explain how children come to use language in particular ways.&lt;/p&gt;

	It does not really explain how children come to use language in particular ways.&lt;br /&gt;
	When US spacewoman Joan Higginbotham is not flying and working in space, she might be found somewhere on earth giving&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	a speech. Higginbotham, who grew up in Chicago and became an engineer before joining NASA, that is the National Air&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and Space Administration, gives about a dozen speeches a year. Each speech is different because she tailors her&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	remarks to each audience. Through interviews and E-mails, she finds out in advance her listeners&amp;#39; educational level&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and what information they want to know. On the subject of space walks, for example, audiences vary in their interests&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and how much complexity they can comprehend. To elementary school children, Higginbotham may discuss a problem that&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	many kids want to know about. &amp;quot;How do spacemen in a spacesuit eat, drink, and go to the bathroom?&amp;quot; Her answer is &amp;quot;the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	spacesuit is really a small spacecraft with room for food and water-containers, and a waste-collection system.&amp;quot; To a&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	high school audience, she might satisfy a curiosity that often arises in her pre-speech interviews with students who&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	obviously have seen many science fiction movies. &amp;quot;Do spacemen carry weapons in case they encounter enemies in space?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Her answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. To scientists, she might provide technical details on such topics as the design of spacesuits that&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	protects spacemen from the deadly temperature extremes of space. Just as elaborate preparation is required for success&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	in space, Higginbotham says that it&amp;#39;s important for speakers to learn as much as possible about their listeners before&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	a speech because every audience is different.&lt;/p&gt;

	One of the greatest heartbreaks for fire fighters occurs when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building because the child, frightened by smoke and noise, hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead. Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse of the masked the fire fighter but hide because they think they have seen a monster. To prevent such tragedies, fire fighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community, explaining that they should never hide during a fire. He displays fire fighters&amp;rsquo; equipment, including the oxygen mask, which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on. &amp;ldquo;If you see us,&amp;rdquo; Velez tells them, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t hide! We are not monsters. We have come to rescue you.&amp;rdquo; Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish. Growing up in San Francisco, he learnt Spanish from his immigrant parents. Velez and other fire fighters throughout North America, who give similar presentations, will never know how many lives they save through their talks. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fact that informative speaking saves lives. For example, several months after listening to an informative speech, Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother who is choking on food, by using the method taught by student speaker, Julie Paris. In addition to saving lives, informative speakers help people learn new skills, solve problems and acquire fascinating facts about the exciting world in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea of life existing somewhere else besides earth. Until&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	recently, scientists believe that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream. But now they are beginning to locate&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	places where life could form. In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun. But scientists now&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	think that life could be even nearer in our own solar system. One place scientists are studying very closely is&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface. The&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	probes have also made scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat. Water&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and heat from volcanic activity are two basic conditions needed for life to form. A third is certain basic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Scientists believe there might be such chemicals lying at the bottom of Europa&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	ocean. They may have already created life or may be about to. You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the surface. And bacteria, primitive forms of life, have been seen&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	there. So the lack of light in Europa&amp;rsquo;s sub-surface ocean doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically rule out life forming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	In her early days as an emergency room physician, Doctor Joanna Myer treated a child who had suffered a second&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	degree burn. After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Doctor Myer talked to the parents&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they&amp;rsquo;d been having over&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	exactly what advice she had given. &amp;ldquo;As I talked to them, I was amazed.&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;rdquo;All of them had heard the simple&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.&amp;rdquo; This episode gave Doctor&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Myer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later- most people just don&amp;rsquo;t listen very well.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Nowadays, she says she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. She asks them&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	tailored to the patients&amp;rsquo; situation. Doc. Myer&amp;rsquo;s listeners are not unusual. When new or difficult material is&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	presented, almost all listeners are faced with the challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	of the printed word. Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Fredrick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	workers. They are merely satisfiers. Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	interesting job, recognition and responsibility. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them. So how do&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	mangers motivate people in such jobs? One solution is to give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as a&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	part of a team. For example, some supermarkets can buy office stuff to people who fill the shelves, and the people who&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	work at the check out into a team, and let them decide what product lines to stock, how to display them and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people now talk about the importance of a company&amp;rsquo;s shared values or culture with which all the staff can&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	identify, for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best, the most user-friendly or the most reliable&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	products in a particular field. Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	automatically only concern a few people. Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s only a limited number of such goals to go around and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	by definition, not all the competing companies in that industry can seriously plan to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;

	Attracting and feeding wild birds are entertaining activities that have long been enjoyed by people all over the world. Feeding birds has become so popular that prepared feed mixtures are readily available. We feed birds for many reasons. Many pleasant hours can come from watching birds. A hobby often develops into a serious study of their habits. Accurate identification of birds is usually the first goal. But observations that an amateur bird-watcher can make are really limitless. There is, however, responsibility associated with bird feeding, including a disease hazard. Attracting numbers of birds continually to the same spot can be harmful to them, particularly species that pick food from the ground contaminated by the droppings of other birds. In winter feeding efforts are most satisfying to people and are of greatest benefit to birds. During this time when fewer natural foods are available and air temperatures are lower, extra feeding can keep a bird warm and well. Once begun, feeding should never stop during these lean months. If you start a local increase of birds, be prepared to do what may be required to eliminate hazards to those you want to befriend. A constant supply of food should be given until the cold is over and spring has come. If feeding is stopped during severe weather, birds used to relying upon the feeders must starve.&lt;br /&gt;

	My friend Leo makes up weak and poor excuses whenever there is something he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to do. Just two weeks ago, he was at my house when he decided he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go into work. He called his boss and said he had to get a new set of tires put on his truck. Then he sat down and watched TV with me. Not only had he lied but his excuse wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very convincing one. Another time, he cancelled a date with his girlfriend at the last minute telling her he had to get a new battery for his truck. She was angry and refused to go out with him again until he apologized. Last weekend, Leo offered the poorest excuse yet. He&amp;rsquo;d promised he&amp;rsquo;d help me move some furniture, from my parents&amp;rsquo; house to my new apartment. He was supposed to bring his truck over about 8 o&amp;rsquo;clock Saturday morning. I waited, and then called and left a message on his machine. About 11:30, he called and said he was sorry but he&amp;rsquo;d been getting a new set of tires put on his truck. I guess he&amp;rsquo;d forgotten he used the same excuse when he called his boss from my house. I think I need a new set of friends. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to get tired of Leo&amp;rsquo;s excuses.&lt;br /&gt;

	In Hollywood, everybody wants to be rich, famous and beautiful. Nobody wants to be old, unknown and poor. For Hollywood kids, life can be difficult because they grow up such an unreal atmosphere. Their parents are ambitious and the children are part of the parents&amp;rsquo; ambitions. Parents pay for wasteful grand parties, expensive cars and designer clothes. When every dream can come true, kids don&amp;rsquo;t learn the value of anything because they have everything. A thirteen-year-old boy, Trent Maguire, has a driver, credit cards and unlimited cash to do what he wants when he wants to. &amp;quot;One day, I&amp;rsquo;ll earn more than my dad!&amp;quot; he boasts. Parents buy care and attention for their children because they have no time to give it themselves. Amender&amp;rsquo;s mother employs a personal trainer, a bodyguard, a singing coach and a councilor to look after all her fifteen-year-old daughter&amp;rsquo;s needs. Often, there is no parent at home most days, so children decide whether to make their own meals or go out to restaurants, when to watch television or do homework. They organize their social life. They play no childhood games. They become adults before they&amp;rsquo;re ready. Hollywood has always been the city of dreams. The kids there live unreal lives where money, beauty and pleasure are the only gods. Will children around the world soon start to think the same? Or do they already?&lt;br /&gt;

All languages have two general levels of (_2_) : a formal level and an informal level. English is no (_3_) . The difference in these two levels is the situation in which you use a (_4_) level. Formal language is the kind of language you find in textbooks, (_5_) books and in business letters. You would also use formal English in compositions and (_6_) that you write in school. Informal language is used in conversation with (_7_) , family members and friends, and when we write (_8_) notes or letters to close friends. Formal language is different from informal language in several ways. First, formal language tends to be more polite. (_9_) For example, I might say to a friend or a family member &amp;ldquo;Close the door, please&amp;rdquo;, (_10_) . Another difference between formal and informal language is some of the vocabulary. (_11_) . Let&amp;rsquo;s say that I really like soccer. If I am talking to my friend, I might say &amp;ldquo;I am just crazy about soccer&amp;rdquo;, but if I were talking to my boss, I would probably say &amp;ldquo;I really enjoy soccer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Around 120 years ago, Ebbinghaus began his study of memory. He (_1_) . on studying how quickly the human mind can remember (_2_) . One result of his research is known as the total time hypothesis(假设), which simply means the amount you learn (_3_) on the time you spend trying to learn it . This can be taken as our first rule of learning.&lt;br /&gt;
	Although it is usually true that studying for four hours is better than studying for one, there is still the question of how we should use the four hours. For example, is it better to study for four hours (_4_) or to study for one hour a day for four days in a (_5_) ?. The answer, as you may have (_6_) , is that it is better to spread out the study times. This (_7_) , through which we can learn more&amp;nbsp;(_8_) .by dividing our practice time, is known as the distribution of practice effect. Thus, (_9_) . &amp;nbsp;But we&amp;rsquo;re not finished yet. We haven&amp;rsquo;t considered how we should study over very short periods of time. (_10_) . Should you look at the same word in rapid succession, or look at the word and then have some delay before you look at it again (_11_)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The flood of women into the job market boosted economic growth and changed U.S. society in many ways. Many in-home jobs that used to be done (_1_)&amp;nbsp;by women----ranging from family shopping to preparing meals to doing (_2_) work-----still need to be done by someone .Husbands and children now do some of these jobs, a (_3_) that has changed the target market for many products. Or a working woman may face a crushing &amp;ldquo;poverty of time &amp;ldquo; and look for help elsewhere , creating opportunities for producers of frozen meals, child care centers, dry cleaners, financial services, and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Although there is still a big wage (_4_) between men and women, the income working women (_5_) gives them new independence and buying power. For example, women now (_6_) about half of all cars. Not long ago, many cars dealers(_7_) women shoppers by ignoring them or suggesting that they come back with their husbands. Now car companies have realized that women are(_8_) customers. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that some leading Japanese car dealers were the first to (_9_) pay attention to women customers. In Japan, fewer women have jobs or buy cars ---- the Japanese society is still very much male&amp;mdash;oriented. Perhaps it was the (_10_) contrast with Japanese society that prompted American firms to pay more attention to women buyers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	What determines the kind of person you are? What factors make you more or less bold, intelligent, or able to read a map? All of these are influenced by the interaction of your genes and the environment in which you were (_1_) . The study of how genes and environment interact to influence (_2_) activity is known as behavioral genetics. Behavioral genetics has made important (_3_) to the biological revolution, providing information about the extent to which biology influences mind, brain and behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	　　Any research that suggests that (_4_) to perform certain behaviors are based in biology is controversial. Who wants to be told that there are limitations to what you can (_5_) based on something that is beyond your control, such as your genes? It is easy to accept that genes control physical characteristics such as sex, race and eye color. But can genes also determine whether people will get divorced, how (_6_) they are, or what career they are likely to choose? A concern of psychological scientists is the (_7_) to which all of these characteristics are influenced by nature and nurture(养育), by genetic makeup and the environment. Increasingly, science (_8_) that genes lay the groundwork for many human traits. From this perspective, people are born (_9_) like undeveloped photographs: The image is already captured, but the way it (_10_) appears can vary based on the development process. However, the basic picture is there from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	In families with two working parents, fathers may have more impact on a child&amp;rsquo;s language development than mothers, a new study suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Researchers (_1_) 92 families from 11 child care centers before their children were a year old, interviewing each to establish income, level of education and child care arrangements. Overall, it was a group of well-educated middle- class families with married parents both living in the home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	When the children were 2, researchers videotaped them at home in free-play sessions with both parent, (_2_) all of their speech. The study will appear in the November issue of The Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The scientists measured the (_3_) number of utterances (话语) of the parents, the number of different words they used, the complexity of their sentences and other (_4_) of their speech. On average, fathers spoke less than mothers did, but they did not differ in the length of utterances or proportion of questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Finally, the researchers (_5_) the children&amp;rsquo;s speech at age 3, using a standardized language test. The only predictors of high scores on the test were the mother&amp;rsquo;s level of education, the (_6_) of child care and the number of different words the father used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The researchers are (_7_) why the father&amp;rsquo;s speech, and not the mother&amp;rsquo;s, had an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s well (_8_) that the mother&amp;rsquo;s language does have an impact,&amp;rdquo; said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	study. It could be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had (_9_) had a strong influence on their children &amp;rsquo;s speech development, Ms. Pancsofar said, &amp;ldquo;or it may be that mothers are (_10_) in a way we didn&amp;rsquo;t measure in the study.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp; Every year in the first week of my English class, some students inform me that writhing is too hard. They never write, unless assignments (_1_) it . They fine the writing process (_2_) and difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How awful to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it- (_3_) English , with its rich vocabulary . Being able to speak but not write is like living in an&amp;nbsp;(_4_) mansion(豪宅) and never leaving one small room . When I meet students who think they can&amp;rsquo;t write, I know as a teacher my&amp;nbsp;(_5_)&amp;nbsp; is to show them the rest of the rooms . My task is to build fluency while providing the opportunity inherent in any writing activity to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_6_) the moral and emotional development of my students . One great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Writing ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_7_) , just like exercise ; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise , writing skills improve quickly with writing practice. I often see a rise in student confidence and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_8_) after only a few weeks of journal writing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Expressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole student. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_9_) lives . They build skills so that some day they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation, or the perfect love letter. Every day that they write in their journals puts them a step&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_)&amp;nbsp; to fluency , eloquence (雄辩), and command of language .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>        They were going to Fort Lauderdale — three boys and three girls — and when they (_1_) the bus, they were carrying sandwiches and wine in paper bags, (_2_) of golden beaches and sea tides as the grey, cold spring of New York (_3_) behind them.&lt;br/&gt;        As the bus (_4_) through New Jersey, they began to notice Vingo. He sat in (_5_) of them, dressed in a plain, ill-fitting (_6_), never moving, his dusty face (_7_) his age. He kept chewing the inside of his lip a lot, (_8_) into complete silence.&lt;br/&gt;        Deep into the night, outside Washington, the bus (_9_) into Howard Johnson's, and everybody got off except Vingo who sat (_10_) in his seat.</Content>

        <Content>        Most English people have three names. The last name, or (_1_) as it is also known, is the family name. This is the family name of the (_2_) and is given to all his children. The first names are given to the child at (_3_), which is why they are called "given" names. Another term used to refer to them is (_4_) names.&lt;br/&gt;        Some people only have one given name, (_5_) have several. It is not unknown for some football (_6_) to give their children eleven names, taken from the names of the players in their (_7_) team. There have been cases where parents have given their child twenty-six names, each (_8_) with a different letter of the alphabet. But such cases are, fortunately for all concerned, rare.&lt;br/&gt;        Parents also have to be careful about the (_9_) of the initial letters of the names they give their children. Initials are often stamped on school satchels（书包） and sewn into school uniforms so children are quick to spot and make fun of anyone whose initials spell any (_10_) word. A child with the family name of Smith who is unfortunate enough to be given the name Andrew Simon will soon find himself teased for being ASS.</Content>

        <Content>        The student population this fall should not be a surprise. The government says there was major growth in the student (_1_) during the 1990s. A new Census Bureau（人口调查局） report says the number (_2_) by about twenty percent during those years. This included (_3_) students, from about age five up through college students.&lt;br/&gt;        In some areas, school populations (_4_) even more. For example, in the West, the state of Nevada had a seventy-six percent increase in the number of students. That seemed natural enough. Nevada had the (_5_) population growth of any state (_6_) the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;        Among other numbers, the Census Bureau says twenty-six percent of high school students work while (_7_) school. And the agency reported a reduction in the number of students who leave high school before they (_8_) their studies. The dropout（辍学学生） rate fell from eleven percent in 1990 to just under ten percent in 2000.&lt;br/&gt;        Another (_9_) says more children are attending (_10_) schools now than in the past. Currently, about ten percent of all the students of elementary or high school age go to private schools.</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. &amp;ldquo;My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.&amp;rdquo; He says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York&amp;rsquo;s municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo&amp;rsquo;s Aquafina and Coca-Cola&amp;rsquo;s Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate(垂涎&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) over the profits. A restaurant&amp;rsquo;s typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it&amp;rsquo;s often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren&amp;rsquo;t available in stores, most dines don&amp;rsquo;t notice or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Regardless of how it&amp;rsquo;s sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;As we have seen, the focus of medical care in our society has been shifting from curing disease to preventing disease &amp;ndash; especially in terms of changing our many unhealthy behaviors, such as poor eating habits, smoking, and failure to exercise. The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight , but does not eat very nutritious(有营养的&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk , and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired. This person is not ill. He may not even be at risk for any particular disease. But we can imagine that this person could be a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The field of medicine has not traditionally distinguished between someone who is merely &amp;ldquo; not ill&amp;rdquo; and someone who is in excellent health and pays attention to the body&amp;rsquo;s special needs. Both types have simply been called &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo;. In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wellness&amp;rdquo; only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise and they&amp;nbsp; make a point of monitoring their body&amp;#39;s condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (缺陷) may be &amp;quot;well,&amp;quot; in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. &amp;quot;Wellness&amp;quot; may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes. And by focusing attention on healthy ways of living, the concept of wellness can have a beneficial impact on the ways in which people face the challenges of daily life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Communications technologies are far from equal when it comes to conveying the truth. The first study to compare honesty across a range of communication media has fund that people are twice as likely to tell lies in phone conversations as they are in emails. The fact that emails are automatically recorded&amp;mdash;and can come back to haunt (困扰) you&amp;mdash;appears to be the key to the finding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Jeff Hancock of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, asked 30 students to keep a communications diary for a week. In it they noted the number of conversations or email exchanges they had lasting more than 10 minutes, and confessed to how many lies they told. Hancock then worked out the number of lies per conversation for each medium. He found that lies made up 14 per cent of emails, 21 per cent of instant messages, 27 per cent of face-to-face interactions and an astonishing 37 per cent of phone calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	His results to be presented at the conference on human-computer interaction in Vienna, Austria, in April, have surprised psychologists. Some expected emailers to be the biggest liars, reasoning that because deception makes people uncomfortable, the detachment (非直接接触) of emailing would make it easier to lie. Others expected people to lie more in face-to-face exchanges because we are most practised at that form of communication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	But Hancock says it is also crucial whether a conversation is being recorded and could be reread, and whether it occurs in real time. People appear to be afraid to lie when they know the communication could later be used to hold them to account, he says. This is why fewer lies appear in email than on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	People are also more likely to lie in real time&amp;mdash;in a instant message or phone call, say&amp;mdash;than if they have time to think of a response, says Hancock. He found many lies are spontaneous (脱口而出的) responses to an unexpected demand, such as: &amp;ldquo;Do you like my dress?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Hancock hopes his research will help companies work our the best ways for their employees to communicate. For instance, the phone might be the best medium foe sales where employees are encouraged to stretch the truth. But, given his result, work assessment where honesty is a priority, might be best done using email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	In a country that defines itself by ideals, not by shared blood, who should be allowed to come work and live here? In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks these questions have never seemed more pressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	On Dec. 11, 2001, as part of the effort to increase homeland security, federal and local authorities in 14 states staged &amp;ldquo;Operation Safe Travel&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;raids on airports to arrest employees with false identification (身份证明). In Salt Lake City there were 69 arrests. But those captured were anything but terrorists, most of them illegal immigrants from Central or South America. Authorities said the undocumented workers&amp;rsquo; illegal status made them open to blackmail (讹诈) by terrorists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Many immigrants in Salt Lake City were angered by the arrests and said they felt as if they were being treated like disposable goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Mayor Anderson said those feelings were justified to a certain extent. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re saying we want you to work in these places, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are, and then when it&amp;rsquo;s convenient for us, or when we can try to make a point in terms of national security, especially after Sept. 11, then you&amp;rsquo;re disposable. There are whole families being uprooted for all of the wrong reasons,&amp;rdquo; Anderson said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	If Sept. 11 had never happened, the airport workers would not have been arrested and could have gone on quietly living in America, probably indefinitely. Ana Castro, a manager at a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s ice cream shop at the airport had been working 10 years with the same false Social Security card when she was arrested in the December airport raid. Now she and her family are living under the threat of deportation (驱逐出境). Castro&amp;rsquo;s case is currently waiting to be settled. While she awaits the outcome, the government has granted her permission to work here and she has returned to her job at Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	If you are a male and you are reading this ,congratulations: you are a survivor .According to statistics .you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman ,and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you will die on average five years before a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	There are many reasons for this-typically, men take more risks than woman and are more likely to drink and smoke but perhaps more importantly, men don&amp;rsquo;t go to the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Men aren&amp;rsquo;t seeing doctors as often as they should,&amp;rdquo; says Dr. Gullotta, &amp;ldquo;This is particularly so for the over-40s, when diseases tend to strike.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old ma who had delayed doing anything about his smoker&amp;rsquo;s cough for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged this life&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	According to a recent survey, 95%of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;A lot of men think they are invincible (不可战胜的)&amp;rdquo;Gullotta says &amp;ldquo;They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think&amp;rdquo; Geez, if it could happen to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Then there is the ostrich approach,&amp;rdquo; some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,&amp;rdquo; says Dr. Ross Cartmill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,&amp;rdquo; Cartmill says .He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says.&amp;rdquo; But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	High-quality customer service is preached(宣扬) by many ,but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store, but instead will alert their friends, relatives, co-workers, strangers-and anyone who will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers decide t frequent their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde group and Wharton school&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains consumers,&amp;rdquo; said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde group.&amp;rdquo; the store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four other, and will no longer visit the specific store for every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative reviews. The resulting &amp;ldquo;snowball effect&amp;rdquo; can be disastrous to retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	According to the research, shoppers who purchased clothing encountered the most problems. Ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered (塞满了的) shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved the parking problems by getting moonlighting local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance climinated the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided confrontation between those eyeing the same parking space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Most importantly, salespeople should be diplomatic and polite with angry customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Retailers who&amp;rsquo;re responsive and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren&amp;rsquo;t so friendly.&amp;rdquo; said Professor Stephen Hoch. &amp;ldquo;Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by filing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. Retailers are hard-pressed to improve when they have no idea what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Throughout this long, tense election, everyone has focused on the presidential candidates and how they&amp;rsquo;ll change America. Rightly so. But selfishly. I&amp;rsquo;m more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an Afircan-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world&amp;rsquo;s attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we&amp;rsquo;re all hot-tempered single mothers who can&amp;rsquo;t keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can&amp;rsquo;t escape the stereotype of being eye-roling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic （酗酒的） mothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	These images have helped define the way all black women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simply to be herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	It won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-Ameircan blogs have written about what they&amp;rsquo;d like to see Michelle bring to the White House&amp;mdash;mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone&amp;mdash;an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that&amp;rsquo;s been around for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	When next year&amp;rsquo;s crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they&amp;rsquo;ll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who&amp;rsquo;ll become Oxford&amp;rsquo;s vice-chancellor&amp;mdash;a position equivalent to university president in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Hamilton isn&amp;rsquo;t the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it&amp;rsquo;s gone global. Yet the talent flow isn&amp;rsquo;t universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The chief reason is that American schools don&amp;rsquo;t tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university&amp;rsquo;s budget. &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do any global consideration,&amp;rdquo; says Patricia Hays, the board&amp;rsquo;s chair. The board ultimately picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university president: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators, and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen (监督) &amp;ldquo;a major strengthening of Yale&amp;rsquo;s financial position.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Of course, fund-raising isn&amp;rsquo;t the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The January fashion show, called FutureFashion , exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to fine . &amp;ldquo;Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren&amp;rsquo;t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and shat your customers are used to,&amp;rdquo; he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco- friendly equivalents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers &amp;amp; Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs(企业家) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable . It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional(过渡型的) cotton at higher prices , thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material . &amp;ldquo;Mainstream is about to occur,&amp;rdquo; says Hahn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Some analysts(分析师) are less sure . Among consumers, only 18%are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer, when asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: &amp;ldquo;Not that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of.&amp;rdquo; Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she&amp;rsquo;s on the hunt for &amp;ldquo;cute stuff that isn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive.&amp;rdquo; By her own admission, green just isn&amp;rsquo;t yet on her mind. But &amp;ndash;thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers &amp;ndash;one day it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair , a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people&amp;rsquo;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re what you eat and drink, and that&amp;rsquo;s recorded in you hair,&amp;rdquo; said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as raid clouds move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable , but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (同位素) . The heaviest raid falls first .As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Cerling&amp;rsquo;s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a mop of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of raid systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not good for pinpointing (精确定位),&amp;rdquo; Cerling said . &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s good for eliminating many possibilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s still a substantial area,&amp;rdquo; Park said &amp;ldquo;But it narrows it way down for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>        Chess must be one of the oldest games in the world. An Arab traveller in India in the year 900 wrote that it was played "long, long ago". Chess was probably invented in India, and it has been played everywhere from Japan to Europe since 1400. The name "chess" is interesting. When one player is attacking the other's king, he says, in English, "check". When the king has been caught and cannot move anywhere, he says "check mate". These words come from Persian. "Shah mat" means "the king is dead". That is when the game is over, and one player has won.&lt;br/&gt;        Such an old game changes very slowly. The rules have not always been the same as they are now. For example, at one time the queen could only move one square at a time. Now she is the strongest piece on the board. It would be interesting to know why this has happened! Chess takes time and thought, but it is a game for all kinds of people. You don't have to be a champion in order to enjoy it. It is not always played by two people sitting at the same table. The first time the Americans beat the Russians was in a match played by radio. Some of the chess masters are able to play many people at the same time. The record was when one man played 400 games! It is said that some people play chess by post. This must make chess the slowest game in the world.</Content>

        <Content>        In the year following the Civil War, businesses began to form monopolies (垄断). A monopoly is a business or corporation that has exclusive control over a certain market. This means that a monopoly has no competitors.&lt;br/&gt;        In business, competition among businesses tends to keep the prices of products down. Since they had no competitors, monopolies, depending on how essential their product was, could charge as much as they wanted for their product.&lt;br/&gt;        As more and more monopolies began to appear, some Americans began to wonder how these big companies could so easily drive their competitors out of business. One person who was especially interested in the practices of these monopolies was a journalist named Ida Tarbell.&lt;br/&gt;        During the early 1900's, Ida Tarbell's articles took on such big corporations as the Standard Oil Trust Company. She described the methods that these monopolies would use to drive rival companies out of business. For example, she described how big companies would make deals with railroad companies. According to the &lt;u&gt;terms&lt;/u&gt; of these deals, the railroad companies would charge the big companies lower rates to transport goods. Smaller companies who competed with the big companies would be charged the regular rate, which was much higher.</Content>

        <Content>        Death comes quickly in the mountains. Each winter, holidaymakers are caught unawares as they happily ski away from the fixed runs, little realizing that a small avalanche (雪崩) can send them crashing in a bone-breaking fall down the slope and leave them buried under tons of crisp white snow. There are lots of theories about how to avoid disaster when hit by an avalanche. Practice is normally less cheerful.&lt;br/&gt;        The snow in the Salzburg area of Austria, where a recent disaster took place, was typical avalanche material. For several days before the incident I had skied locally. Early winter snow was wearing thin and covered with ice. On the top of that, new, warmer flakes (雪片) were gently falling to produce a dangerous carpet. To the skier who enjoys unmarked slopes it is tempting stuff, deep new powder snow on a hard base -- the skiing that dreams are made of. And sometimes nightmares. Snow falls in sections like a cake. Different sections will have different densities because of the temperatures at the time of the fall and in the weeks afterwards. Problems come when any particular section is too thick and not sticking to the section beneath. The snow of the past few weeks had been falling in rather higher temperatures than those of December and early January. The result of these conditions is that even a slight increase in the temperature sends a thin stream of water between the new snow and the old. Then the new snow simply slides off the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;        Such slides are not unexpected. Local citizens know the slopes which tend to avalanche and the weather in which such slides are likely. Traps are set to catch the snow or prevent it slipping; bombs are placed and exploded from time to time to set off small avalanches before a big one has time to build up; and, above all, skiers are warned not to ski in danger areas.&lt;br/&gt;        In spite of this, avalanches happen in unexpected areas and, of course, skiers ignore the warnings. The one comfort to recreational skiers, however, is that avalanche incidents on the marked ski slopes are quite rare. No ski resort wants the image of being a death trap.</Content>

	(_1_) Employers should realise it is important to keep older workers in the workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_2_) A recent study found that most old people in some European countries had regular weekly contact with their adult children.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_3_) Few governments in rich countries have launched bold reforms to tackle the problem of population ageing.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_4_) In a report published some 20 years ago, the sustainability of old-age pension systems in most countries was called into doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_5_) Countries that have a shortage of young adults will be less willing to send them to war.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_6_) One-child families are more common in ageing societies due to the stress of urban life and the difficulties of balancing families and career.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_7_) A series of books, mostly authored by Americans, warned of confilicts between the older and younger generations.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_8_) Compared with younger ones, older societies tend to be less innovative and take fewer risks.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_9_) The best solution to the pension crisis is to postpone the retirement age.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_10_) Immigration as a means to boost the shrinking labour force may meet with resistance in some rich countries.&lt;br /&gt;
	Into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;unknown&lt;br /&gt;
	A) Until the early 1900s nobodu thought much about the whole populations getting older. UN had the foresignt to convene a &amp;quot;world assembly on ageing&amp;quot; back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled &amp;quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&amp;quot;, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;
	B)&amp;nbsp;For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, surrounded by the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.&lt;br /&gt;
	C) Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue reguar reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits, The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including the newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
	D) Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another quesion. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.&lt;br /&gt;
	E) The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the&amp;nbsp;opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time.&amp;nbsp;It may even keep them&amp;nbsp;alive longer. John Rother, the AARP&amp;#39;s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.&lt;br /&gt;
	F) Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may to because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour forece, increasing employers&amp;#39; choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.&lt;br /&gt;
	G)&amp;nbsp;In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;
	H) On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in the need of jobs, many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in&amp;nbsp;western&amp;nbsp;Europe&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;youthful&amp;nbsp;countries,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;times&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;ones.&amp;nbsp;Japan would&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;few&amp;nbsp;immigrants&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;present.&amp;nbsp;Public opinion polls&amp;nbsp;show&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;rich&amp;nbsp;countries already&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;immigration&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;too high. Further&amp;nbsp;big&amp;nbsp;increases&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;unfeasible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	I) To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.&lt;br /&gt;
	J)&amp;nbsp;And&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;fertility&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;pick&amp;nbsp;up?&amp;nbsp;It&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50-and older people turn out to vote in much greater numbers than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
	K)&amp;nbsp;Nor is&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;sign&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;intergenerational&amp;nbsp;warfare&amp;nbsp;predicted&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;1990s.&amp;nbsp;After&amp;nbsp;all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten&amp;nbsp;Hank&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Mannheim&amp;nbsp;University found&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;85%&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;lived&amp;nbsp;within&amp;nbsp;25km&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;each&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;majority&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them were&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;touch&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;least&amp;nbsp;once&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	L)&amp;nbsp;Even&amp;nbsp;so,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shift&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;centre&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;gravity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;age&amp;nbsp;groups&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;bound&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;a profound&amp;nbsp;effect&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;societies, not&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;economically&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;sorts of&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;ways&amp;nbsp;too. Richard Jackson and Neil&amp;nbsp;Howe&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;CSIS, in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;thoughtful book&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Graying&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great&amp;nbsp;Powers, argue&amp;nbsp;that, among&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.&lt;br /&gt;
	M)&amp;nbsp;For&amp;nbsp;example,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shortage&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;young&amp;nbsp;adults&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;likely&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world&amp;#39;s defence effort. Because America&amp;#39;s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically.&lt;br /&gt;
	N)&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;little&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;stop&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing,&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;to live&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;consequences&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;alleviated.&amp;nbsp;Many&amp;nbsp;experts&amp;nbsp;now believe that given the right policies, the&amp;nbsp;effects, though&amp;nbsp;grave, need&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be catastrophic. Most&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;recognised&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;something&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;are beginning&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	O)&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;even&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;guarantee&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;efforts&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. The director of Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: &amp;quot;We&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t really&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;what&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;like,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;nobody&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;Language is the most astonishing behavior in the animal kingdom. It is the species-typical behavior that sets humans completely&amp;nbsp;(_1_)from all other animals. Language is a means of communication,&amp;nbsp;(_2_) it is much more than that. Many animals can&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_3_). The dance of the honeybee communicates the location of flowers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_4_)other members of the hive(蜂群). But human language permits communication about anything.&amp;nbsp;(_5_) things like unicorn(独角兽&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)that have never existed. The key&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_6_) in the fact that the units of meaning, words, can be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_7_)together in different ways, according to&amp;nbsp;(_8_),to communicate different meanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Language is the most important learning we do. Nothing&amp;nbsp;(_9_) humans so much as our ability to communicate abstract thoughts,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_)about the university the mind, love, dreams, or ordering a drink, It is an immensely complex&amp;nbsp;(_11_) that we take for granted. Indeed, we are not aware of most&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_12_) of our speech and understanding. Consider what happens when one person is speaking to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_13_).The Speaker has to translate thoughts into &lt;/strong&gt;(_14_) &lt;strong&gt;language. Brain imaging studies suggest that the time from thoughts to the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_15_) of speech is extremely fast. Only 0.04 seconds! The listener must hear the sounds to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_16_)out what the speaker means. He must use the sounds of speech to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_17_) the words spoken., understand the pattern of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_18_) of the words (sentences), and finally&amp;nbsp;(_19_) the meaning. This takes somewhat longer, a minimum of about 0.5 seconds. But&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_20_) started, it is of course a continuous process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>        Scientists searching for precious metals have turned to the ocean floor, where natural chimneys are spewing out (喷出) a metal-enriched black dust containing particles of gold, silver and zinc (锌).&lt;br/&gt;        Scientists (_1_) these hot springs are recreating the process which, billions of years ago, created (_2_) metal deposits now found on land.&lt;br/&gt;        The discovery is giving geologists a (_3_) into the earth's early history and fuelling some new theories on origin of life.&lt;br/&gt;        It also has huge implications for (_4_) companies.&lt;br/&gt;        Geologists are just beginning to understand how these chimneys, (_5_) clusters of sulphur and minerals (硫), are formed, and what makes them spew out the mineralized dust (含矿尘).&lt;br/&gt;        At present it is not commercially (_6_) for mining companies to operate beneath the sea, although some scientists believe the "black smokers", (_7_) known as active mineralizing systems, will be a major --- and renewable (可更新的；再生的) --- source of metals in the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;        (_8_) the meantime, mining companies are using the ocean-floor research to locate similar deposits on land.&lt;br/&gt;        "The hottest thing in the mining research game right now is the (_9_) within the past few years of mineral deposits currently forming --- in front of our eyes --- on the ocean floor," said Dr. Joseph Fox, a Montreal (加拿大蒙特利尔) geologist.&lt;br/&gt;        Canada has mined some of the richest copper, zinc and gold (_10_) in the world. In the past year, mining companies have used knowledge about where mineral formations (_11_) on the ocean floor to find the deposits on land.&lt;br/&gt;        Geologists are excited because, (_12_) metal deposits on land, which are two or three billion years old, the undersea deposits keep (_13_) themselves.&lt;br/&gt;        "It's really incredible to think that we have a renewable metal resource (_14_) we've been taught to think of metal resources as non-renewable," Fox said.&lt;br/&gt;        The 30-foot-high (10-metre) chimneys or vents (喷口), (_15_) in 1979, are found along fractures in the ocean's crust (海洋地壳断裂层).&lt;br/&gt;        Scientists believe the deposits form when cold sea-water seeps into the fractures, leaching (熔化) metals (_16_) it is drawn down.&lt;br/&gt;        As the water travels in the direction of the earth's core, it (_17_) up. Eventually, the hot water rises, carrying with it the hot metal sulphide (_18_) the ocean floor.&lt;br/&gt;        When the hot sulphide meets the cold sea water, a thick black smoke-like substance is formed, spewing out of vents in built-up deposits of (_19_).&lt;br/&gt;        The particles in the smoke eventually (_20_) on the ocean floor, forming vast solid sheets of metal sulphide.</Content>
