        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	That&amp;rsquo;s enough, kids&lt;br/&gt;	It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he&amp;rsquo;d shoved,&amp;rdquo; she says.&amp;rdquo; I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, &amp;rsquo;No, we don&amp;rsquo;t push,&amp;rdquo; What happened next was unexpected.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;The boy&amp;rsquo;s mother ran toward me from across the park,&amp;rdquo; Stella says,&amp;rdquo; I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for disciplining her child, All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted, hurting other children in the process?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people&amp;rsquo;s children has become a minefield.&lt;br/&gt;	In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister&amp;rsquo;s house it&amp;rsquo;s encouraged. For her, it&amp;rsquo;s about kids being kids:&amp;rdquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t do it at three, when can you do it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Each of these philosophies is valid and, it has to be said, my son loves visiting his aunt&amp;rsquo;s house. But I find myself saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; a lot when her kids are over at mine. That&amp;rsquo;s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous territory when you&amp;rsquo;re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Kids aren&amp;rsquo;t all raised the same,&amp;rdquo; agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University.&amp;rdquo; But there is still an idea that they&amp;rsquo;re the property of the parent. We see our children as an extension of ourselves, so if you&amp;rsquo;re saying that my child is behaving inappropriately, then that&amp;rsquo;s somehow a criticism of me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	In those circumstances, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two schools of thought.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d go to the child first,&amp;rdquo; says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. Usually a quiet reminder that &amp;rsquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t do that here&amp;rsquo; is enough. Kids nave finely tuned antennae (直觉) for how to behave in different settings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel neglectful, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.&lt;br/&gt;	This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents if they&amp;rsquo;re there and ask them to deal with it,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;br/&gt;	Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers:&amp;rdquo;Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Preface your remarks with something like: &amp;rsquo;I know you&amp;rsquo;ll think I&amp;rsquo;m silly but in my house I don&amp;rsquo;t want&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	When it comes to situations where you&amp;rsquo;re caring for another child, white is straightforward: &amp;ldquo;common sense must prevail. If things don&amp;rsquo;t go well, then have a chat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	There&amp;rsquo;re a couple of new grey areas. Physical punishment, once accepted from any adult, is no longer appropriate. &amp;ldquo;A new set of considerations has come to the fore as part of the debate about how we handle children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	For Andrew Fuller, the child-centric nature of our society has affected everyone:&amp;rdquo; The rules are different now from when today&amp;rsquo;s parents were growing up,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;Adults are scared of saying: &amp;rsquo;don&amp;rsquo;t swear&amp;rsquo;, or asking a child to stand up on a bus. They&amp;rsquo;re worried that there will be conflict if they point these things out &amp;ndash; either from older children, or their parents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	He sees it as a loss of the sense of common public good and public courtesy (礼貌), and says that adults suffer form it as much as child.&lt;br/&gt;	Meredith Fuller agrees: &amp;ldquo;A code of conduct is hard to create when you&amp;rsquo;re living in a world in which everyone is exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, and a world in which nice people are perceived to finish last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and what I need,&amp;rdquo; Andrew Fuller says. &amp;rdquo;The days when a kid came home from school and said, &amp;ldquo;I got into trouble&amp;rdquo;. And dad said, &amp;lsquo;you probably deserved it&amp;rsquo;, are over. Now the parents are charging up to the school to have a go at teachers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	This jumping to our children&amp;rsquo;s defense is part of what fuels the &amp;ldquo;walking on eggshells&amp;rdquo; feeling that surrounds our dealings with other people&amp;rsquo;s children. You know that if you remonstrate(劝诫) with the child, you&amp;#39;re going to have to deal with the parent. It&amp;rsquo;s admirable to be protective of our kids, but is it good?&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Children have to learn to negotiate the world on their own, within reasonable boundaries,&amp;rdquo; White says. &amp;ldquo;I suspect that it&amp;rsquo;s only certain sectors of the population doing the running to the school &amp;ndash;better &amp;ndash;educated parents are probably more likely to be too involved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	White believes our notions of a more child-centred, it&amp;#39;s a way of talking about treating our children like commodities(商品). We&amp;rsquo;re centred on them but in ways that reflect positively on us. We treat them as objects whose appearance and achievements are something we can be proud of, rather than serve the best interests of the children.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	One way over-worked, under-resourced parents show commitment to their children is to leap to their defence. Back at the park, Bianchi&amp;#39;s intervention(干预) on her son&amp;#39;s behalf ended in an undignified exchange of insulting words with the other boy&amp;#39;s mother.&lt;br/&gt;	As Bianchi approached the park bench where she&amp;rsquo;d been sitting, other mums came up to her and congratulated her on taking a stand. &amp;ldquo;Apparently the boy had a longstanding reputation for bad behaviour and his mum for even worse behaviour if he was challenged.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Andrew Fuller doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe that we should be afraid of dealing with other people&amp;rsquo;s kids. &amp;ldquo;Look at kids that aren&amp;rsquo;t your own as a potential minefield,&amp;rdquo; he says. He recommends that we don&amp;rsquo;t stay silent over inappropriate behaviour, particularly with regular visitors.&lt;br/&gt;	注意：此部分试题请在答题卡1上作答。&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; F: Simon, how does it feel to be retired?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: How have you been spending your time?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I have been spending more time with my family. I&amp;rsquo;ve also travelled a bit, you know, off season when everywhere is less crowded and hotels cost less.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: Great.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: You know I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped work completely.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: Yes, could you tell us more about this?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I&amp;rsquo;m on a scheme that&amp;rsquo;s called phased retirement; I had a six-month break from work, after that I could apply for project work with the company I used to work for.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: How does the scheme work?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a trial at the moment. Instead of hiring temporary stuff, the company advertises posts on its website that retired employees like myself can access.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: What sort of works advertised?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, all sorts of things, really. Administrative work and more specialized work, the sort of thing I can do. Some of the projects can last five or six months, and others can just be a couple of days. I can decide more or less when to work. So I can manage my own time.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　F: I can see it&amp;rsquo;s good for you. What is your company get out of this?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, I still have all my old contacts at work, so I know who to contact to get something done. The company gets flexibility, too. Once the job&amp;rsquo;s over, that&amp;rsquo;s it. I&amp;rsquo;m not on their books any more.&lt;br /&gt;

	　　M: I want to show you something.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: I know, but what is it?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: A farm. It&amp;rsquo;s just down this road. It&amp;rsquo;s a small place, but at least it would be our own.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: A farm? How can we afford to buy a farm?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: It isn&amp;rsquo;t very large, only 40 acres. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay very much right now.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Is there a house on the place?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: A small one, two bedrooms, but it needs to be fixed up a little. I can do the job myself.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: OK. Is there enough space for a kitchen garden?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: There is about half an acre around the house. That&amp;rsquo;s plenty of space.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Then we can grow our own fresh vegetables. And maybe keep a few chickens, couldn&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Yes, and we can probably grow a lot of our own food.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: What are you thinking about growing, if we do take this place?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, it really isn&amp;rsquo;t big enough for corn. I thought we might try to raise a crop of potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Potatoes? There are a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: We are used to hard work, aren&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Yes, we are, but the money. Do we have enough to get started? It seems like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I think we&amp;rsquo;ve saved enough. We can pay a little on the farm and maybe put a few dollars down on the tractor, too.&lt;br /&gt;

	Members of the city council and distinguished guests, it is my privilege to introduce to you today Mr. Robert&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Washington, chief of our city&amp;rsquo;s police force. He will address us on the subject of the Community Policing Program.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most of you know that Mr. Washington has a distinguished record as head of our police force for more than ten years.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	However, you may not know that he also holds a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in criminology and studied abroad for a year with the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	international police force which deals with crimes around the world. Mr. Washington first introduced the Community&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Policing Program 8 years ago. The idea behind the program is to get the police officers out of their cars and into our&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	neighborhoods where they can talk directly to merchants and residents about the real dynamics of our city. These&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	officers do more than make arrests. They try to find ways to help solve the problems that contribute to crime in the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	first place. Often that means hooking people up with services offered by other city agencies, such as schools,&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	hospitals, housing, drug treatment centers. And the program seems to be working: crime is down and our citizens report&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	that they feel more secure. Today Mr. Washington is going to tell us more about this program. Now let&amp;rsquo;s welcome Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Robert Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

	There are between 3000 and 6000 public languages in the world, and we must add approximately 6 billion private&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	languages since each one of us necessarily has one. Considering these facts, the possibilities for breakdowns in&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	communication seem infinite in number. However, we do communicate successfully from time to time. And we do learn to&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	speak languages. But learning to speak languages seems to be a very mysterious process. For a long time, people&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	thought that we learned a language only by imitation and association. For example, a baby touches a hot pot and starts&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	to cry. The mother says, &amp;ldquo;Hot, hot!&amp;rdquo; And the baby, when it stops crying, imitates the mother and says, &amp;ldquo;Hot, hot!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	However, Noam Chomsky, a famous expert in language, pointed out that although children do learn some words by&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	imitation and association, they also combine words to make meaningful sentences in ways that are unique, unlearned and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	creative. Because young children can make sentences they have never heard before, Chomsky suggested that human infants&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	are born with the ability to learn language. Chomsky meant that underneath all the differences between public and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	private languages, there is a universal language mechanism that makes it possible for us, as infants, to learn any&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	language in the world. This theory explains the potential that human infants have for learning language. But it does&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	not really explain how children come to use language in particular ways.&lt;/p&gt;

	It does not really explain how children come to use language in particular ways.&lt;br /&gt;
	When US spacewoman Joan Higginbotham is not flying and working in space, she might be found somewhere on earth giving&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	a speech. Higginbotham, who grew up in Chicago and became an engineer before joining NASA, that is the National Air&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and Space Administration, gives about a dozen speeches a year. Each speech is different because she tailors her&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	remarks to each audience. Through interviews and E-mails, she finds out in advance her listeners&amp;#39; educational level&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and what information they want to know. On the subject of space walks, for example, audiences vary in their interests&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and how much complexity they can comprehend. To elementary school children, Higginbotham may discuss a problem that&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	many kids want to know about. &amp;quot;How do spacemen in a spacesuit eat, drink, and go to the bathroom?&amp;quot; Her answer is &amp;quot;the&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	spacesuit is really a small spacecraft with room for food and water-containers, and a waste-collection system.&amp;quot; To a&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	high school audience, she might satisfy a curiosity that often arises in her pre-speech interviews with students who&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	obviously have seen many science fiction movies. &amp;quot;Do spacemen carry weapons in case they encounter enemies in space?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Her answer is &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;. To scientists, she might provide technical details on such topics as the design of spacesuits that&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	protects spacemen from the deadly temperature extremes of space. Just as elaborate preparation is required for success&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	in space, Higginbotham says that it&amp;#39;s important for speakers to learn as much as possible about their listeners before&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	a speech because every audience is different.&lt;/p&gt;

They meet the natural (_1_) for freedom, for expression, for creativity and beauty of life. Learners, therefore, must have books, and the right type of book, for the satisfaction of their need. Readers turn (_2_) to books because their curiosity concerning all manners of things, their eagerness to share in the experiences of others and their need to (_3_) from their own limited environment lead them to find in books food for the mind and the spirit. Through their reading they find a deeper significance to life as books acquaint them with life in the world as it was and it is now. They are presented with a (_4_) of human experiences and come to (_5_) other ways of thought and living. And while (_6_) their own relationships and responses to life , the readers often find that the&amp;nbsp; (_7_) in their stories are going through similar adjustments, which help to clarify and give significance to their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Books provide (_8_) material for readers&amp;rsquo; imagination to grow. Imagination is a valuable quality and a motivating power, and stimulates achievement. While enriching their imagination, books (_9_) their outlook, develop a fact-finding attitude and train them to use leisure (_10_) . The social and educational significance of the readers&amp;rsquo; books cannot be overestimated in an academic library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	If you are a male and you are reading this ,congratulations: you are a survivor .According to statistics .you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman ,and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you will die on average five years before a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	There are many reasons for this-typically, men take more risks than woman and are more likely to drink and smoke but perhaps more importantly, men don&amp;rsquo;t go to the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Men aren&amp;rsquo;t seeing doctors as often as they should,&amp;rdquo; says Dr. Gullotta, &amp;ldquo;This is particularly so for the over-40s, when diseases tend to strike.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old ma who had delayed doing anything about his smoker&amp;rsquo;s cough for a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged this life&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	According to a recent survey, 95%of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;A lot of men think they are invincible (不可战胜的)&amp;rdquo;Gullotta says &amp;ldquo;They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think&amp;rdquo; Geez, if it could happen to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Then there is the ostrich approach,&amp;rdquo; some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,&amp;rdquo; says Dr. Ross Cartmill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,&amp;rdquo; Cartmill says .He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says.&amp;rdquo; But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	High-quality customer service is preached(宣扬) by many ,but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store, but instead will alert their friends, relatives, co-workers, strangers-and anyone who will listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers decide t frequent their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde group and Wharton school&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains consumers,&amp;rdquo; said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde group.&amp;rdquo; the store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four other, and will no longer visit the specific store for every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative reviews. The resulting &amp;ldquo;snowball effect&amp;rdquo; can be disastrous to retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	According to the research, shoppers who purchased clothing encountered the most problems. Ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered (塞满了的) shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved the parking problems by getting moonlighting local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance climinated the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided confrontation between those eyeing the same parking space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Most importantly, salespeople should be diplomatic and polite with angry customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Retailers who&amp;rsquo;re responsive and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren&amp;rsquo;t so friendly.&amp;rdquo; said Professor Stephen Hoch. &amp;ldquo;Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by filing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. Retailers are hard-pressed to improve when they have no idea what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
