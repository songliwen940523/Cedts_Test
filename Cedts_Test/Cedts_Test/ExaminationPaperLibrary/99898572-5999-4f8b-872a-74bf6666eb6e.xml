        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Brainstorming in Three Easy Steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Sometimes, it's the easiest writing assignments that send us for a loop. Coming up with something to write about can often be harder than the actual writing. Luckily, there is an easy solution to that-brainstorming. Brainstorming comes in many different forms. Choosing the right method of brainstorming is a fun and easy task! &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Freewriting&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        Freewriting is the easiest form of brainstorming. The method is very simple: write! Freewriting is most often a timed exercise. The best way to freewrite is to choose your method of writing (either on the computer or with pen and paper) and simply write whatever comes to mind for approximately five minutes. Don't worry about spelling, grammar or clarity-none of those issues matter in freewriting. Keeping your words flowing is the most important part. Even if you have to write, "I can't think of anything to write," you're still doing the exercise correctly. What's great about freewriting is that it allows ideas that might be buried to come to the surface. Sometimes you have several possible topics in your head but nerves or fear keep them buried. Freewriting takes away any stumbling blocks and leaves you with only words. You'll be amazed at how many potential topics you come up with! &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Clustering&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        The clustering method works best when you have a general idea of a topic you're interested in writing about but that seems to be a bit too broad. For example, if you wanted to write about education, you would need to pick a more specified topic. Clustering works by allowing your mind to make connections visually. To brainstorm using the clustering method, simply write your broad topic in the middle of a sheet of paper and circle it. Then, create subtopics by drawing lines from your main topic to your new point, which you have also circled. As you find more subtopics, create new lines and circles. You'll also want to create subtopics for your subtopics. Creating this web of ideas will help you narrow your focus and also find new topics that you weren't aware of. &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Question Method&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;        My favorite form of brainstorming comes a little later in the writing process. Once you have chosen a topic to write about, it is important to get feedback. Sometimes a chosen topic is good but could be more precise. The best way to get feedback is to create a question group. To do this, you should form a group of several people. Each person should write his or her topic down on the top of a sheet of paper. Once this is completed, pass around the sheets of paper with topics. Each time you receive a topic sheet, ask a question about that topic that hasn't been asked yet. This will require you to think about new topics you haven't seen, but it will also give the writer new ideas to consider about the topic. I've used this method several times in English courses and always had great success. &lt;br/&gt;        As you can see, brainstorming doesn't need to be a complicated process. Take advantage of the ease of brainstorming and also the fun you can have with it! You'll have better topics to write about and more exciting ideas to focus on!</Content>

        <Script>M: Could I have your advice?
W: What about, David?
M: Well, I've put off doing my science requirement for three years.
W: And if you want to graduate this year, you've got to take a science course.
M: Right. I suppose since you are doing pre-medical, you know about the different courses.
W: Well, I have to take biology, chemistry, maths and physics. What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors.
M: Yeah, I'm really weak in math. I did poorly in it in high school.
W: Then you'd better avoid chemistry and physics. How about astronomy? Everybody says Dr. Hanson is great. I'd take that course myself if I had the time.
M: That's what I thought I'd take. But it meets at the same time with my modern music course.
W: Geology is pretty interesting, then.
M: That's a good idea. It even fits in with my hobby of mountain climbing. Thanks a lot!</Script>

W: Let me see that . . . Oh, Dad.
M: What?
W: You're missing a page!
M: Oh, uh, well, I couldn't find the second page of the recipe, but don't worry. I have plenty of experience around the house. Plenty of experience cooking.
W: That's not what mom says.
M: Well, wait, wait, here let me try a piece first. Here, let me, let me cool this off here. Ohhh, yeah. Oh, this is great stuff.
W: Yeah right. Why are you making that face?
M: Well, well, it's just, just a little rich for me. That's all.
W: Let me try it Dad. Uh. Dad. You put a little too much salt in it and besides it's burned. And what's that?
M: Oh, well, well, that's just part of my own adaptation to the recipe. I added some pumpkin.
W: Oh, not another one of your surprises. Pumpkin doesn't go on pizza!
M: Well, okay, well, so what? Uh, what do we do now?
W: Well, how about some cold cereal . . . You can't mess up on that, Dad.</Script>

        <Script>“Google”, the popular Internet search engine, offers a page called “Google News”, a summary of what is going on in a world inhabited entirely by computers.
   Clearly, the day is approaching when editors can be replaced by computers. This requires some urgent rethinking.
   Throughout the revolution of technology and globalization that has been going on for two decades, many believe that progress is a good thing. Some people are unfortunately caught in the wheels of change, but society as a whole benefits.
   We must distinguish, however, between making an exception and being worried about deeply troubling developments. It is one thing to sacrifice textile workers for progress. It is quite another to start throwing reporters into the flames of progress. It's very different.
   You see, journalists are responsible for reporting and analyzing the important issues of the day. In the prestige ranking of important issues, a key factor is how much an issue actually touches anyone's daily life.
   What happens when all the human editors have been eliminated? We know the answer from the movie "2001". In the movie a computer took over a space station and killed all the inhabitants. We will wake up one day to find that all the news is about the narrow-minded concerns of computers while important human developments get ignored.
   No doubt there are writers and policy analysts of all sorts who think today "They are going after editors, but I can never be replaced by a machine." Ladies and gentleman, that's what the editor thought.</Script>

        </Questions>
        <Script>Each university and college in the United States has different requirements for gaining admission to their MBA programs. There are also several different types of MBA programs available. Here is a brief outline of the different types of MBAs offered:
&lt;B&gt;1. Full-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The full-time MBA offers core courses that span all management disciplines. Students can also select from a variety of optional courses. The program usually takes between 18 and 24 months to complete. Students must attend classes at the business school on most weekdays. 
&lt;B&gt;2. Part-Time MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The part-time MBA offers core courses and optional courses similar to the full-time program. Some schools allow students up to 7 years to complete their study, though the majority of part-time students will complete the program in 2 or 3 years. The part-time program usually appeals to students who are currently working, so classes are held at night and/or on the weekends. 
&lt;B&gt;3. On-Line MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The on-line program offers a core of general courses with a limited number of optional courses. The programs can take up to 8 years to complete, though students generally finish in 3 or 4 years. Coursework uses e-mail, computer conferencing, chat rooms, on-line bulletin boards, and sound and video clips. It is very important to make sure the program is recognized so hiring companies will consider it valid. 
&lt;B&gt;4. Executive MBA&lt;/B&gt;
The executive MBA, or EMBA, is generally designed for senior managers with at least 10 years of business experience. The courses tend to focus on global business issues and strategies. The program is very structured, with courses offered in sequence and students moving as one through the various steps. The program is generally considered full-time and can take up to 24 months to complete. Usually classes are held on the weekends and the work requires group projects and meetings. The EMBA is considered very prestigious; ranking and reputation of the school definitely matter.</Script>

        <Script>The convenience and economy of small cars account for their popularity. They are easy to park quickly and take smaller parking spaces. Small cars are also a means of conserving energy because they use less gas than big cars. Small cars are inconvenient and uncomfortable on long trips. However, because of their limited passenger and trunk space, they are also more economical to operate and maintain. And they cost less. Because of all these advantages, the next car I buy is going to be an Econo-Midget.</Script>

        <Content>        The man who, legend has it, escaped from an early grave when his uncle pulled him from drowning in a dirty pond is notorious for his dirty deeds but what cannot be forgotten are his achievements in the 1986 World Cup. The man is Maradona.&lt;br/&gt;        Forget the handball against England, feel the quality of his 50-yard solo goal in the same game and the near repeat performance in the semi-final against Belgium. The Argentina side of 1986 was functional and hard-working but it was Maradona who fired them to the final and then set up two of the goals in their 3-2 win over West Germany in the final.&lt;br/&gt;        In 1990, a barely-fit Maradona fought his way to the final where the Germans took their revenge. Few people shared Diego’s post-match tears. In fact many rejoiced that such an ugly brute of a team had lost.&lt;br/&gt;        Eight years before, in Spain, Maradona, then newly arrived at Barcelona, disgraced himself by being sent off in a Second Phase game with Brazil. Even four years before that the 18-year-old Maradona was a source of great controversy when he was left out of the victorious squad that won on home ground.&lt;br/&gt;        USA 1994 was the end for Maradona as a player. Right after the Nigeria game, he was picked for drugs-screening and tested positive for banned stimulant ephedrine (麻黄硷). He was banned from the rest of the tournament and the team fell apart, going out in the second round to Romania.</Content>

        <Content>        At one point along an open highway, I came to a crossroads with a traffic light. I was alone on the road by now, but as I approached the light, it turned red, and I braked to a halt. I looked left, right, and behind me. Nothing. Not a car, no suggestion of headlights, but there I sat, waiting for the light to change, the only human being for at least a mile in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;        I started wondering why I refused to run the light. I was not afraid of being arrested, because there was obviously no cop anywhere around and there certainly would have been no danger in going through it.&lt;br/&gt;        Much later that night, after I'd met with a group in Lewisburg and had climbed into bed near midnight, the question of why I'd stopped for that light came back to me. I think I stopped because it's part of a contract we all have with each other. It's not only the law, but it's an agreement we have, and we trust each other to honor it: We don't go through red lights. Like most of us, I'm more apt to be restrained from doing something bad by the social convention that disapproves of it than by any law against it.&lt;br/&gt;        It's amazing that we ever trust each other to do the right thing, isn't it? And we do, too. Trust is our first inclination. We have to make a deliberate decision to mistrust someone or to be suspicious or skeptical.</Content>

	(_1_) Employers should realise it is important to keep older workers in the workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_2_) A recent study found that most old people in some European countries had regular weekly contact with their adult children.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_3_) Few governments in rich countries have launched bold reforms to tackle the problem of population ageing.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_4_) In a report published some 20 years ago, the sustainability of old-age pension systems in most countries was called into doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_5_) Countries that have a shortage of young adults will be less willing to send them to war.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_6_) One-child families are more common in ageing societies due to the stress of urban life and the difficulties of balancing families and career.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_7_) A series of books, mostly authored by Americans, warned of confilicts between the older and younger generations.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_8_) Compared with younger ones, older societies tend to be less innovative and take fewer risks.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_9_) The best solution to the pension crisis is to postpone the retirement age.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_10_) Immigration as a means to boost the shrinking labour force may meet with resistance in some rich countries.&lt;br /&gt;
	Into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;unknown&lt;br /&gt;
	A) Until the early 1900s nobodu thought much about the whole populations getting older. UN had the foresignt to convene a &amp;quot;world assembly on ageing&amp;quot; back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled &amp;quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&amp;quot;, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;
	B)&amp;nbsp;For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, surrounded by the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.&lt;br /&gt;
	C) Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue reguar reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits, The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including the newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
	D) Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another quesion. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.&lt;br /&gt;
	E) The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the&amp;nbsp;opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time.&amp;nbsp;It may even keep them&amp;nbsp;alive longer. John Rother, the AARP&amp;#39;s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.&lt;br /&gt;
	F) Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may to because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour forece, increasing employers&amp;#39; choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.&lt;br /&gt;
	G)&amp;nbsp;In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;
	H) On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in the need of jobs, many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in&amp;nbsp;western&amp;nbsp;Europe&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;youthful&amp;nbsp;countries,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;times&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;ones.&amp;nbsp;Japan would&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;few&amp;nbsp;immigrants&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;present.&amp;nbsp;Public opinion polls&amp;nbsp;show&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;rich&amp;nbsp;countries already&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;immigration&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;too high. Further&amp;nbsp;big&amp;nbsp;increases&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;unfeasible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	I) To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.&lt;br /&gt;
	J)&amp;nbsp;And&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;fertility&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;pick&amp;nbsp;up?&amp;nbsp;It&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50-and older people turn out to vote in much greater numbers than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
	K)&amp;nbsp;Nor is&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;sign&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;intergenerational&amp;nbsp;warfare&amp;nbsp;predicted&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;1990s.&amp;nbsp;After&amp;nbsp;all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten&amp;nbsp;Hank&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Mannheim&amp;nbsp;University found&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;85%&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;lived&amp;nbsp;within&amp;nbsp;25km&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;each&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;majority&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them were&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;touch&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;least&amp;nbsp;once&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	L)&amp;nbsp;Even&amp;nbsp;so,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shift&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;centre&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;gravity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;age&amp;nbsp;groups&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;bound&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;a profound&amp;nbsp;effect&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;societies, not&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;economically&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;sorts of&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;ways&amp;nbsp;too. Richard Jackson and Neil&amp;nbsp;Howe&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;CSIS, in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;thoughtful book&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Graying&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great&amp;nbsp;Powers, argue&amp;nbsp;that, among&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.&lt;br /&gt;
	M)&amp;nbsp;For&amp;nbsp;example,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shortage&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;young&amp;nbsp;adults&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;likely&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world&amp;#39;s defence effort. Because America&amp;#39;s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically.&lt;br /&gt;
	N)&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;little&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;stop&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing,&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;to live&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;consequences&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;alleviated.&amp;nbsp;Many&amp;nbsp;experts&amp;nbsp;now believe that given the right policies, the&amp;nbsp;effects, though&amp;nbsp;grave, need&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be catastrophic. Most&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;recognised&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;something&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;are beginning&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	O)&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;even&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;guarantee&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;efforts&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. The director of Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: &amp;quot;We&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t really&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;what&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;like,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;nobody&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
