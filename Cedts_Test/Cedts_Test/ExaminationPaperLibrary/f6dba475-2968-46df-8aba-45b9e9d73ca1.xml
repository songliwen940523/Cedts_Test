        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	A Grassroots Remedy&lt;br/&gt;	　　Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers (慢跑者) jog, they don&amp;rsquo;t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.&lt;br/&gt;	　　But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, South London. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.&lt;br/&gt;	　　The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD&amp;mdash;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.&lt;br/&gt;	　　A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy (等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Most bullying (恃强凌弱) is found in schools where there is a tarmac (柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;	　　But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.&lt;br/&gt;	　　One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.&lt;br/&gt;	　　The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.&lt;br/&gt;	　　In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, &amp;ldquo;A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour.&amp;rdquo; Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.&lt;br/&gt;	　　We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Human beings are a species of mammals (哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.&lt;br/&gt;	　　We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Five ways to find harmony with the natural world&lt;br/&gt;	　　Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that&amp;rsquo;s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.&lt;br/&gt;	　　Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home. It lasts forever, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	M: Mrs. Dawson, thanks very much for coming down to the station. I just like to go over some of the things that you told police officer Parmer at the bank.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: All right.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, could you describe the man who robbed the bank for this report that we&amp;rsquo;re filling out here? Now, anything at all that you can remember would be extremely helpful to us.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, just, I can only remember basically what I said before.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: That&amp;rsquo;s all right.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: The man was tall, six foot, and he had dark hair, and he had moustache.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Very good. All right, did he have any other distinguishing marks?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Um, no, none that I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Do you remember how old he was by any chance?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I guess around 30, maybe younger, give or take a few years.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Mm, all right. Do you remember anything about what he was wearing?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes, yes, he had on a dark sweater, a solid color.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: OK. Um, anything else that strikes you at the moment?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I remember he was wearing a light shirt under the sweater. Yes, yes.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: All right. Mrs. Dawson, I really appreciate what you&amp;rsquo;ve been through today. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to ask you to look at some photographs before you leave if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind. It won&amp;rsquo;t take very long. Can you do that for me?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Would you like to step this way with me, please?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: OK, sure.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;

	W: Good morning, I&amp;rsquo;m calling about the job that was in the paper last night.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, could you tell me your name?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Candidate Foreset.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh yes. What exactly is it that interests you about the job?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I thought it was just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Really? Um&amp;hellip; Could you tell me a little about yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Yes. I&amp;rsquo;m 23. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working abroad.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Where exactly have you been working?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: In Geneva.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Oh, Geneva. And what were you doing there?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Secretarial work. Previous to that, I was at university.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Which university was that?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: The University of Manchester. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a degree in English.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: You said you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in Geneva. Do you have any special reason for wanting to come back?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: I thought it would be nice to be near to the family.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see, and how do you see yourself developing in this job?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Well, I&amp;rsquo;m ambitious. I do hope that my career as a secretary will lead me eventually into management.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I see. You have foreign languages?&lt;br /&gt;
	W: French and Italian.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, I think the best thing for you to do is do reply a writing to the advertisement.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Can&amp;rsquo;t I arrange for an interview now?&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Well, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid we must wait until all the applications are in, in writing, and then decide on the short list. If you are on the short list, of course we should see you.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, I see.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: I look forward to receiving your application in writing in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;
	W: Oh, yes, yes, certainly.&lt;br /&gt;
	M: Ok, thank you very much. Goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;

	One of the greatest heartbreaks for fire fighters occurs when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building because the child, frightened by smoke and noise, hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead. Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse of the masked the fire fighter but hide because they think they have seen a monster. To prevent such tragedies, fire fighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community, explaining that they should never hide during a fire. He displays fire fighters&amp;rsquo; equipment, including the oxygen mask, which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on. &amp;ldquo;If you see us,&amp;rdquo; Velez tells them, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t hide! We are not monsters. We have come to rescue you.&amp;rdquo; Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish. Growing up in San Francisco, he learnt Spanish from his immigrant parents. Velez and other fire fighters throughout North America, who give similar presentations, will never know how many lives they save through their talks. But it&amp;rsquo;s a fact that informative speaking saves lives. For example, several months after listening to an informative speech, Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother who is choking on food, by using the method taught by student speaker, Julie Paris. In addition to saving lives, informative speakers help people learn new skills, solve problems and acquire fascinating facts about the exciting world in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	What determines the kind of person you are? What factors make you more or less bold, intelligent, or able to read a map? All of these are influenced by the interaction of your genes and the environment in which you were (_1_) .

Who wants to be told that there are limitations to what you can (_5_) based on something that is beyond your control, such as your genes? It is easy to accept that genes control physical characteristics such as sex, race and eye color. But can genes also determine whether people will get divorced, how (_6_) they are, or what career they are likely to choose? A concern of psychological scientists is the (_7_) to which all of these characteristics are influenced by nature and nurture(养育), by genetic makeup and the environment. Increasingly, science (_8_) that genes lay the groundwork for many human traits. From this perspective, people are born (_9_) like undeveloped photographs: The image is already captured, but the way it (_10_) appears can vary based on the development process.
