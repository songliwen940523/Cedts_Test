Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. &amp;ldquo;I just can&amp;rsquo;t get started&amp;rdquo; people say. But it&amp;rsquo;s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.&lt;br/&gt;	What you&amp;rsquo;re seeking is not physical energy. It&amp;rsquo;s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.&lt;br/&gt;	And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circum stances of their lives. Eyen as a child observed people who were poor or disabled or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of be to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.&lt;br/&gt;	Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or up bringing. So how do you get it? You can&amp;rsquo;t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.&lt;br/&gt;	1.Do something new.&lt;br/&gt;	Very little that&amp;rsquo;s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It&amp;#39;s like a tire with a slow leak. You don&amp;#39;t it at first, but eventually you&amp;#39;ll get a flat. It&amp;#39;s up to you to plug the leak--even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That&amp;#39;s where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.&lt;br/&gt;	Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline--a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.&lt;br/&gt;	Here&amp;#39;s a challenge: If it&amp;#39;s something you wouldn&amp;#39;t ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you&amp;#39;ve never eaten. Listen to music you&amp;#39;d ordinarily tune out. You&amp;#39;ll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.&lt;br/&gt;	2.Reclaim life&amp;#39;s meaning.&lt;br/&gt;	So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went state.&lt;br/&gt;	The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. &amp;quot;I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something.&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life.&amp;quot; Ivy&amp;#39;s solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.&lt;br/&gt;	3.Put yourself in the fun zone.&lt;br/&gt;	Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. &amp;quot;I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like withy a little tender loving care,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a challenge--and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;	We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.&lt;br/&gt;	4.Bid farewell to guilt and regret.&lt;br/&gt;	Everyone&amp;#39;s past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from us from moving forward. While they can&amp;#39;t merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.&lt;br/&gt;	5.Make up your mind.&lt;br/&gt;	Say you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish &amp;ndash; or too extreme?&lt;br/&gt;	You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.&lt;br/&gt;	Every time you can&amp;rsquo;t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don&amp;rsquo;t look back.&lt;br/&gt;	6.Give to get.&lt;br/&gt;	Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter., You have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.&lt;br/&gt;	Start by asking everyone you meet, &amp;ldquo;How are you?&amp;rdquo; as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don&amp;rsquo;t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you&amp;rsquo;re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person&amp;mdash;and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (按摩) to someone you love, or cook her dinner, Then, expand the circle to work. Try asking yourself what you&amp;rsquo;d do if your goal were to be helpful rather than efficient.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;After all, if it&amp;rsquo;s true that what goes around comes around, why not make sure that what&amp;rsquo;s circulating around you is the good stuff?&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; W: Hey, Bob, guess what? I&amp;rsquo;m going to visit Quebec next summer. I&amp;rsquo;m invited to go to a friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　But while I&amp;rsquo;m there I&amp;rsquo;d also like to do some sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: That&amp;rsquo;s nice, Shelly. But do you mean the province of Quebec, or Quebec City?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: I mean the province. My friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding is in Montreal. I&amp;rsquo;m going there first. I&amp;rsquo;ll stay for five days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Well, Many people think so because it&amp;rsquo;s the biggest city. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the capital. Quebec City is. But Montreal is great. The Saint Royal River runs right through the middle of the city. It&amp;rsquo;s beautiful in summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is OK, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Well, People speak both French and English there. But you&amp;rsquo;ll hear French most of the time. And all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French speaking city in the world. So you&amp;rsquo;d better practice your French before you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Good advice. What about Quebec City? I&amp;rsquo;ll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What&amp;rsquo;s it like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th or 18th centuries. You&amp;rsquo;ll love there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: Fantastic. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;M: Hi, Miss Rowling, how old were you when you started to write? And what was your first book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: I wrote my first Finnish (finished) story when I was about six. It was about a small animal, a rabbit, I mean. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing ever since?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Why did you choose to be an author?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: If someone asked me how to achieve happiness. Step One would be finding out what you love doing most. Step two would be finding someone to pay you to do this. I consider myself very lucky indeed to be able to support myself by writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Do you have any plans to write books for adults?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　W: My first two novels were for adults. I suppose I might write another one. But I never really imagine a target audience when I&amp;rsquo;m writing. The ideas come first. So it really depends on the ideas that grasp me next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: where did the ideas for the &amp;ldquo;Harry Potter&amp;rdquo; books come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　I&amp;rsquo;ve no ideas where the ideas came from. And I hope I&amp;rsquo;ll never find out. It would spoil my excitement if it turned out I just have a funny wrinkle on the surface of my brain, which makes me think about the invisible train platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: How did you come up with the names of your characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　I invented some of them. But I also collected strange names. I&amp;rsquo;ve got one from ancient saints, maps, dictionaries, plants, war memoirs and people I met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	　　M: Oh, you are really resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;

	Reducing the amount of sleep students get at night has a direct impact on their performance at school during the day. According to classroom teachers, elementary and middle school students who stay up late exhibit more learning and attention problems. This has been shown by Brown Medical School and Bradley Hospital research. In the study, teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received when completing weekly performance reports, yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less as having the most trouble recalling all the material，learning new lessons and completing high-quality work. Teachers also reported that these students had more difficulty paying attention. The experiment is the first to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children. Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well-functioning kids, said Garharn Forlone, the study&amp;rsquo;s lead author. So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message: when a child is having learning and attention problems, the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration. &amp;ldquo;If we don&amp;rsquo;t ask about sleep, and try to improve sleep patterns in kids&amp;rsquo; struggling academically, then we aren&amp;rsquo;t doing our job&amp;rdquo;, Forlone said. For parents, he said, the message is simple, &amp;ldquo;getting kids to bed on time is as important as getting them to school on time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

	Patricia Pena never wanted to be a public figure. All she wanted to be was a mother and home-maker. But her life was turned upside down when a motorist, distracted by his cell phone, ran a stop sign and crashed into the side of her car. The impact killed her 2-year-old daughter. Four months later, Pena reluctantly but courageously decided to try to educate the public and to fight for laws to ban drivers from using cell phones while a car is moving. She wanted to save other children from what happened to her daughter. In her first speech, Pena got off to a shaky start. She was visibly trembling and her voice was soft and uncertain. But as she got into her speech, a dramatic transformation took place. She stopped shaking and spoke with a strong voice. For the rest of her talk, she was a forceful and compelling speaker. She wanted everyone in the audience to know what she knew without having to learn it from a personal tragedy. Many in the audience were moved to tears and to action. In subsequent presentations, Pena gained reputation as a highly effective speaker. Her appearance on a talk show was broadcast three times, transmitting her message to over 40 million people. Her campaign increased public awareness of the problem, and prompted over 300 cities and several states to consider restrictions on cell phone use.&lt;/p&gt;

	Many people catch a cold in the spring time or fall. It makes us wonder if scientists can send a man to the moon, why can&amp;rsquo;t they find a cure for the common cold. The answer is easy. There&amp;rsquo;re actually hundreds of kinds of cold viruses out there. You never know which one you will get, so there isn&amp;rsquo;t a cure for each one. When a virus attacks your body, your body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and causes a blockade in it. You feel terrible because you can&amp;rsquo;t breathe well, but your body is actually eating the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting into your cells. You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold. Different people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and some other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot bath and drink warm liquids. Other people take medicines to relieve various symptoms of colds. There was one interesting thing to note. Some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you. The virus stays in you longer, because your body doesn&amp;rsquo;t develop a way to fight it and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

All languages have two general levels of (_2_) : a formal level and an informal level. English is no (_3_) . The difference in these two levels is the situation in which you use a (_4_) level. Formal language is the kind of language you find in textbooks, (_5_) books and in business letters. You would also use formal English in compositions and (_6_) that you write in school. Informal language is used in conversation with (_7_) , family members and friends, and when we write (_8_) notes or letters to close friends. Formal language is different from informal language in several ways. First, formal language tends to be more polite. (_9_) For example, I might say to a friend or a family member &amp;ldquo;Close the door, please&amp;rdquo;, (_10_) . Another difference between formal and informal language is some of the vocabulary. (_11_) . Let&amp;rsquo;s say that I really like soccer. If I am talking to my friend, I might say &amp;ldquo;I am just crazy about soccer&amp;rdquo;, but if I were talking to my boss, I would probably say &amp;ldquo;I really enjoy soccer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. &amp;ldquo;My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water.&amp;rdquo; He says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York&amp;rsquo;s municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo&amp;rsquo;s Aquafina and Coca-Cola&amp;rsquo;s Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate(垂涎&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) over the profits. A restaurant&amp;rsquo;s typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it&amp;rsquo;s often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren&amp;rsquo;t available in stores, most dines don&amp;rsquo;t notice or care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Regardless of how it&amp;rsquo;s sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;As we have seen, the focus of medical care in our society has been shifting from curing disease to preventing disease &amp;ndash; especially in terms of changing our many unhealthy behaviors, such as poor eating habits, smoking, and failure to exercise. The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight , but does not eat very nutritious(有营养的&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk , and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired. This person is not ill. He may not even be at risk for any particular disease. But we can imagine that this person could be a lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The field of medicine has not traditionally distinguished between someone who is merely &amp;ldquo; not ill&amp;rdquo; and someone who is in excellent health and pays attention to the body&amp;rsquo;s special needs. Both types have simply been called &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo;. In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wellness&amp;rdquo; only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise and they&amp;nbsp; make a point of monitoring their body&amp;#39;s condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (缺陷) may be &amp;quot;well,&amp;quot; in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. &amp;quot;Wellness&amp;quot; may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes. And by focusing attention on healthy ways of living, the concept of wellness can have a beneficial impact on the ways in which people face the challenges of daily life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;strong&gt;Language is the most astonishing behavior in the animal kingdom. It is the species-typical behavior that sets humans completely&amp;nbsp;(_1_)from all other animals. Language is a means of communication,&amp;nbsp;(_2_) it is much more than that. Many animals can&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_3_). The dance of the honeybee communicates the location of flowers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_4_)other members of the hive(蜂群). But human language permits communication about anything.&amp;nbsp;(_5_) things like unicorn(独角兽&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)that have never existed. The key&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_6_) in the fact that the units of meaning, words, can be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_7_)together in different ways, according to&amp;nbsp;(_8_),to communicate different meanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Language is the most important learning we do. Nothing&amp;nbsp;(_9_) humans so much as our ability to communicate abstract thoughts,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_10_)about the university the mind, love, dreams, or ordering a drink, It is an immensely complex&amp;nbsp;(_11_) that we take for granted. Indeed, we are not aware of most&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_12_) of our speech and understanding. Consider what happens when one person is speaking to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_13_).The Speaker has to translate thoughts into &lt;/strong&gt;(_14_) &lt;strong&gt;language. Brain imaging studies suggest that the time from thoughts to the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_15_) of speech is extremely fast. Only 0.04 seconds! The listener must hear the sounds to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_16_)out what the speaker means. He must use the sounds of speech to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_17_) the words spoken., understand the pattern of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_18_) of the words (sentences), and finally&amp;nbsp;(_19_) the meaning. This takes somewhat longer, a minimum of about 0.5 seconds. But&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(_20_) started, it is of course a continuous process.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
