        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;	Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid*&lt;br/&gt;	Good grades and high test scores still matter&amp;mdash;a lot&amp;mdash;to many colleges as they award financial aid.&lt;br/&gt;	But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examing whether that aid, typically known as &amp;ldquo;merit aid&amp;rdquo;, is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars.&lt;br/&gt;	George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients (接受者), pouring the savings, about $2.5million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.&lt;br/&gt;	Now, Hamilton College in Clinton. N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.&lt;br/&gt;	Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don&amp;rsquo;t meet need eligibility (资格) have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.&lt;br/&gt;	For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above scholarship amount to keep the institution running.&lt;br/&gt;	But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profiles. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re trying to buy students,&amp;rdquo; says Skidmore Colllege economist Sandy Baum.&lt;br/&gt;	Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,&amp;rdquo; says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News &amp;amp; World Report&amp;rsquo;s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.&lt;br/&gt;	Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $1 million a year, &amp;ldquo;served us well,&amp;rdquo; Inzer says, but &amp;ldquo;to be discounting the price for families that don&amp;rsquo;t need financial aid doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right any more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.&lt;br/&gt;	Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state&amp;rsquo;s public institutions.&lt;br/&gt;	But in recent years, a growing chorus (异口同声) of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be &amp;ldquo;a sign that people are starting to realize that there&amp;rsquo;s this destructive competition going on.&amp;rdquo; says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.&lt;br/&gt;	David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;No one can take one-sided action,&amp;rdquo; says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption (豁免) from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid. &amp;ldquo;This is a merry-go-round that&amp;rsquo;s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don&amp;rsquo;t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.&lt;br/&gt;	That is one reason Allegheny College doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan to drop merit aid entirely.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,&amp;rdquo; says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny&amp;rsquo;s vice president for enrollment.&lt;br/&gt;	Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment (捐赠), meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;Yeah, we&amp;rsquo;re playing the merit game,&amp;rdquo; acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong points, too, he says, &amp;ldquo;The fact of the matter is, it&amp;rsquo;s not just about the lowest-income people. It&amp;rsquo;s the average American middle-class family who&amp;rsquo;s being priced out of the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;	*A few words about merit-based aid:&lt;br/&gt;	Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.&lt;br/&gt;	Academic merit scholarships are based on students&amp;rsquo; grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a tearcher as part of the qualification process.&lt;br/&gt;	Athletic merit scholarships are meant for student that excel (突出) in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee (裁判). Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance.&lt;br/&gt;	Artistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio （选辑） of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; W: Hello, Cartson College, may I help you?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Yes. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for information on courses in computer programming. I would need it for the fall semester.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Do you want a day or evening course?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, it would have to be an evening course since I work during the day.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Aha. Have you taken any courses in data processing?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: No.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Oh! Well, data processing is a course you have to take before you can take computer programming.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Oh, I see. Well, when is it given? I hope it is not on Thursdays.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Well, there&amp;rsquo;s a class that meets on Monday evenings at 7.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Just once a week?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Yes. But that&amp;rsquo;s almost 3 hours from 7 to 9:45.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Oh! Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all right, I could manage that. How many weeks does the course last?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Mm, let me see. 12 weeks. You start the first weekends September and finish&amp;hellip;Oh.. just before Christmas, December 21st.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: And how much is the course?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: That&amp;rsquo;s 300 dollars including the necessary computer time.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Ah-hum. Okay, Eh, where do I go to register?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Registration is on the second and third of September between 6 and 9 in Frost Hall.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Is that the round building behind the parking lot?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s the one.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Oh, I know how to get there. Is there anything that I should bring with me?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: No, just your check book.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Well, thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: You&amp;rsquo;re very welcome. Bye!&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Bye!&lt;br /&gt;
	　　Questions 19 to 22 are based on the conversation you have just heard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; W: So, why exactly does your job have reputation for being stressful?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Stress is generally driven by the feeling of being out of control of a situation and the feeling of a situation controlling you. Trading in financial markets combines both.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: How do you relax in the evening?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I very rarely do anything work-related so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to escape the markets. I generally go to the gym or go for a run, especially if I had a bad day. I always cook a meal rather than have a take-away. To do something my brain will regard as creative.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Do you think what you do to relax is an effective way to beat stress?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is a specific rule about how to beat stress. I generally find out what I do is effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: Would you consider changing your job because of the high stress factor?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: I have considered leaving my job due to stress-related factors. However, I do think that an element of stress is a good thing. And if used the right way can actually be a positive thing.&lt;br /&gt;
	　　W: What do you enjoy about the stressful aspects of your job?&lt;br /&gt;
	　　M: Having said all that, I do actually enjoy an element of uncertainty. I enjoy mental challenge. Trading generates a wide range of emotions second by second. How you deal with and manage those emotions dictates short medium and long term trading performance and success.&lt;/p&gt;

	Since early times, people have been fascinated with the idea of life existing somewhere else besides earth. Until&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	recently, scientists believe that life on other planets was just a hopeful dream. But now they are beginning to locate&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	places where life could form. In 1997, they saw evidence of planets near other stars like the sun. But scientists now&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	think that life could be even nearer in our own solar system. One place scientists are studying very closely is&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Space probes have provided evidence that Europa has a large ocean under its surface. The&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	probes have also made scientists think that under its surface Europa has a rocky core giving off volcanic heat. Water&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and heat from volcanic activity are two basic conditions needed for life to form. A third is certain basic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	such as carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. Scientists believe there might be such chemicals lying at the bottom of Europa&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	ocean. They may have already created life or may be about to. You may wonder if light is also needed for life to form.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Until recently, scientists thought that light was essential. But now, places have been found on earth that are in&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	total blackness such as caves several miles beneath the surface. And bacteria, primitive forms of life, have been seen&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	there. So the lack of light in Europa&amp;rsquo;s sub-surface ocean doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically rule out life forming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <Script>&lt;p&gt;
	In her early days as an emergency room physician, Doctor Joanna Myer treated a child who had suffered a second&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	degree burn. After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge, Doctor Myer talked to the parents&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they&amp;rsquo;d been having over&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	exactly what advice she had given. &amp;ldquo;As I talked to them, I was amazed.&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;rdquo;All of them had heard the simple&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different versions. The most basic&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	details were unclear and confusing. I was surprised, because these were intelligent people.&amp;rdquo; This episode gave Doctor&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Myer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later- most people just don&amp;rsquo;t listen very well.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Nowadays, she says she repeats her instructions, and even conducts a reality check with some patients. She asks them&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	tailored to the patients&amp;rsquo; situation. Doc. Myer&amp;rsquo;s listeners are not unusual. When new or difficult material is&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	presented, almost all listeners are faced with the challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	of the printed word. Oral communication is fast-moving and impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;

	It&amp;rsquo;s logical to suppose that things like good labor relations, good working conditions, good wages and benefits&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	and job security motivate workers, but one expert, Fredrick Herzberg argued that such conditions do not motivate&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	workers. They are merely satisfiers. Motivators, in contrast, include things such as having a challenging and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	interesting job, recognition and responsibility. However, even with the development of computers and robotics, there&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	re always plenty of boring, repetitive and mechanical jobs and lots of unskilled people who have to do them. So how do&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	mangers motivate people in such jobs? One solution is to give them some responsibilities, not as individuals, but as a&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	part of a team. For example, some supermarkets can buy office stuff to people who fill the shelves, and the people who&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	work at the check out into a team, and let them decide what product lines to stock, how to display them and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Many people now talk about the importance of a company&amp;rsquo;s shared values or culture with which all the staff can&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	identify, for example, being the best hotel chain, or making the best, the most user-friendly or the most reliable&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	products in a particular field. Such values are more likely to motivate workers than financial targets which&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	automatically only concern a few people. Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s only a limited number of such goals to go around and&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	by definition, not all the competing companies in that industry can seriously plan to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;

	In the humanities, authors write to inform you in many ways. These methods can be (_1_) into three types of informational writing: factual, descriptive, and process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Factual writing provides (_2_) information on an author, composer, or artist or on a type of music, literature, or art. Example of factual writing include notes on a book jacket or (_3_) cover and longer pieces, such as an article describing a style of music which you might read in a music (_4_) courses. This kind of writing provides a (_5_) for your study of the humanities. As its name (_6_)&amp;nbsp; , descriptive writing simply describes, or provides an (_7_) of, a piece of music, art, or literature. For example, descriptive writing might list the colors an artist used in a painting or the (_8_) a composer included in a musical composition, so as to make pictures or sounds in the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind by callingup specific details of the work. (_9_). Process writing explains a series of actions that bring about a result (_10_). This kind of writing is often found in art,where understanding how an artist created a certain effect is important. (_11_) .&lt;/p&gt;

The only predictors of high scores on the test were the mother&amp;rsquo;s level of education, the (_6_) of child care and the number of different words the father used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The researchers are (_7_) why the father&amp;rsquo;s speech, and not the mother&amp;rsquo;s, had an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s well (_8_) that the mother&amp;rsquo;s language does have an impact,&amp;rdquo; said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	study. It could be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had (_9_) had a strong influence on their children &amp;rsquo;s speech development, Ms. Pancsofar said, &amp;ldquo;or it may be that mothers are (_10_) in a way we didn&amp;rsquo;t measure in the study.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Throughout this long, tense election, everyone has focused on the presidential candidates and how they&amp;rsquo;ll change America. Rightly so. But selfishly. I&amp;rsquo;m more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an Afircan-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world&amp;rsquo;s attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we&amp;rsquo;re all hot-tempered single mothers who can&amp;rsquo;t keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can&amp;rsquo;t escape the stereotype of being eye-roling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic （酗酒的） mothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	These images have helped define the way all black women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simply to be herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	It won&amp;rsquo;t be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-Ameircan blogs have written about what they&amp;rsquo;d like to see Michelle bring to the White House&amp;mdash;mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone&amp;mdash;an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that&amp;rsquo;s been around for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>

        <Content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	When next year&amp;rsquo;s crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they&amp;rsquo;ll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who&amp;rsquo;ll become Oxford&amp;rsquo;s vice-chancellor&amp;mdash;a position equivalent to university president in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Hamilton isn&amp;rsquo;t the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it&amp;rsquo;s gone global. Yet the talent flow isn&amp;rsquo;t universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	The chief reason is that American schools don&amp;rsquo;t tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university&amp;rsquo;s budget. &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do any global consideration,&amp;rdquo; says Patricia Hays, the board&amp;rsquo;s chair. The board ultimately picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university president: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators, and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen (监督) &amp;ldquo;a major strengthening of Yale&amp;rsquo;s financial position.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	Of course, fund-raising isn&amp;rsquo;t the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind to promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</Content>
