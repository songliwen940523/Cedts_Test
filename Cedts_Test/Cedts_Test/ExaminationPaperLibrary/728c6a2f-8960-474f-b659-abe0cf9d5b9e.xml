        </Questions>
        <Script>W: How do you normally spend your evenings?
M: I've joined the gym here, so I go and exercise and go for a swim.
W: Swim. How long do you stay each time?
M: About 2 hours.
W: Wow. So what do you do during those two hours?
M: So we go to the gym for about an hour and then have a swim for half an hour and then sauna for about ten minutes and then finish off with a massage.
W: Really, a massaging chair?
M: A massaging chair!
W: Wonderful, and so who do you go with? 
M: I go with Jim.
W: And Jim is? 
M: He's another teacher and he's who I live with.
W: Now when you're in the gym, do you do weights? Do you do aerobics? Running? Walking? 
M: We do everything really. Aerobics and weights.
W: Aerobics and weights are the best.
M: The gyms here are much better than back home.
W: Oh, yeah. What's the biggest difference?
M: They have games on the machines so if you're cycling, you're also playing a game where you have to blow up the other cyclists so it makes it a bit more interesting than just exercising.
W: Uh-huh! So it passes the time by. Yeah, lot quicker. And then why are you exercising? Do you have a certain reason, a goal in mind?
M: Yeah, because I put on a lot of weight when I was in Australia because I was eating too much pizza and, good breakfast, and drinking far too much beer.
W: So you just want to shed those extra pounds.
M: Yeah, I want to get back to the original weight.
W: Well, good luck to you.</Script>

        <Script>W: Where can I stay in this town?
M: There are lots of hotels, but they tend to be fairly expensive. And there are bed and breakfast places, which are much cheaper — and you can find out about them through looking in the paper, or just walking around the streets. They have signs in the window saying \"Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast\". There are youth hostels, too.
W: What are the youth hostels like?
M: The youth hostels are ok. All you get is a bed, but they do tend to be very cheap.
W: Do I have to become a member?
M: Yes, you do, in fact. But it's very easy to join, and there's an office along the road where you can go and sign on.</Script>

        <Script>As outstanding examples of southern China's private gardens, Suzhou's classical gardens are famous for their exquisite design and layout. The landscape and buildings are perfectly integrated, to create a great harmony between man and nature.
        Thanks to careful protection and good management, several of the gardens have been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, including Zhuozheng Garden, Wangshi Garden, Liuyuan Garden, Huanxiu Villa, Canglangting Garden, and etc. These gardens demonstrate the typical features of Suzhou's classical gardens in layout, structure, design, style, use of color, decoration and furniture. Suzhou's classical gardens occupy a unique position in the history of world landscape gardening, and have high value for the study of Chinese landscape gardening.
Canglangting Garden has the longest history among all the existing classical gardens in Suzhou. Naturally laid out and well designed, it is called one of the four best gardens in Suzhou. The garden looks simple but natural. Without contrived decorations, it combines buildings with scenery so perfectly that the whole garden appears to be naturally endowed. The garden is built along a small pond. In front of its north gate, there is a stone bridge. Entering the garden, you can see a yellow rockery. Behind it, there is an artificial hill made of stone and earth. Since there is a courtyard on each side of the garden, it is named Ouyuan, meaning double courtyard.</Script>

        <Script>Forty-eight people were killed late last night when a big fire 
swept through the Rose Hotel on Baker Street. Most of the guests 
were unable to escape from the hotel because the elevators had been turned off 
and there were no outside fire escapes. The hotel had apparently not been checked 
by safety officials for more than a year. It is believed that the fire was caused 
by a burning cigarette-end left by a guest, and when the fire came up, both the 
alarm and the water systems were not working. Over a hundred guests were injured 
when they jumped from windows instead of waiting to be rescued by firemen. It 
appears that the staff on night duty were sleeping. When they woke up, they tried 
to warn the guests before calling the fire department.</Script>

        <Script>A number of values and beliefs in traditional societies tend to decrease the amount of money people are willing and able to take from their income and make available for productive investment. In many of these societies, gold and silver, houses and land have been some of the ways in which wealth has been stored. Attempts to encourage people to keep their savings in monetary form often meet strong resistance, which is simply increased in times like these of rapid inflation.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to increasing savings and investments in the traditional society is the pressure of increasing population. In such countries, there is still a direct relationship between the amount of food available and the number of people who must be fed and thus cannot be used to increase the standard of living.</Script>

        <Content>        Short, unattractive, dwarfed by the grand oaks and poplars nearby and unnoticed by the tourists passing in horse-drawn carriages, it's a tree that only birds and nut-hungry squirrels could love. But on Thursday, the 100-year-old European beech (山毛榉树) on Central Park's Cherry Hill was the center of attention — chosen by New York city officials as the first of 25 "historical" trees to be cloned as part of a plan announced last year to add a million new trees to streets, parks and public spaces over the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;        Agriculture students from a Queens high school rode tree-trimmers' buckets to upper branches of the 60-foot tree and cut off 6- to 12-inch sections of new growth, to be sent to a scientific tree nursery in eastern Oregon. If all goes well, the genetic copies will be sent back in two years to New York for replanting. "We want to break the stereotype of New York as skyscrapers and sidewalks," Parks Commissioner Adrian Benape said. "New York abounds in historical trees."&lt;br/&gt;        The target trees include nine different species. All were selected by borough foresters (护林员) as historical for having existed for at least a century — either as the urban landscape or as having special significance to local communities. City partners in the cloning effort include the Central Park Conservancy, a private group that manages the 840-acre park; Bartlett Tree Experts, a century-old Connecticut-based company that has tree care contracts in New York, 25 other states, Canada, England and Ireland; the nonprofit Tree Fund, and the Coleman Co., a camping equipment maker, whose coolers would be used to ship the cuttings to Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;        David McMaster, a Bartlett vice president, said the cloning would target several "Olmsted trees," dating from the creation of Central Park by famed architect Frederick Law Olmsted in the late 1850s. Benape said being less than beautiful did not affect the European beech tree's potential contribution to a greener New York. "Like the other trees to be cloned, it has withstood the test of time and the indignities of urban life," he said. "These trees as a result tend to be hardier species, inherently disease resistant. They are a great reaffirmation of the importance of nature in New York City — trees so good that people are looking to clone them."</Content>

        <Content>        Deaths from cigarettes are likely to more than triple over the next quarter century to 20 every minute around the world, scientists warn in a new global survey. The survey covers 45 countries, 15 more than the previous study. The additional nations are from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.&lt;br/&gt;        Sixty million deaths have been caused by smoking since the 1950s, the investigators estimate. They predict smoking will kill about 10 million people a year by 2020, the vast majority in developing countries where the habit continues to attract young women.&lt;br/&gt;        Investigators were unable to acquire smoking statistics from every country, which would allow the most precise estimates. Instead, they compared data on lung-cancer death rates among American non-smokers to the lung-cancer death rate in each country to get an estimate of the number of smoking in a nation.&lt;br/&gt;        The researchers said they used lung-cancer rates as the yardstick (标尺) because in developed countries, lung cancer is closely related to smoking and so seldom caused by any other factor among non-smokers.&lt;br/&gt;        According to the report, 10 percent of middle-age British men will die from smoking by the time they are 35 to 69 years old. In Poland, 20 percent of men are doomed to die from smoking, the researchers predict.</Content>

	(_1_) Employers should realise it is important to keep older workers in the workforce.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_2_) A recent study found that most old people in some European countries had regular weekly contact with their adult children.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_3_) Few governments in rich countries have launched bold reforms to tackle the problem of population ageing.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_4_) In a report published some 20 years ago, the sustainability of old-age pension systems in most countries was called into doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_5_) Countries that have a shortage of young adults will be less willing to send them to war.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_6_) One-child families are more common in ageing societies due to the stress of urban life and the difficulties of balancing families and career.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_7_) A series of books, mostly authored by Americans, warned of confilicts between the older and younger generations.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_8_) Compared with younger ones, older societies tend to be less innovative and take fewer risks.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_9_) The best solution to the pension crisis is to postpone the retirement age.&lt;br /&gt;
	(_10_) Immigration as a means to boost the shrinking labour force may meet with resistance in some rich countries.&lt;br /&gt;
	Into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;unknown&lt;br /&gt;
	A) Until the early 1900s nobodu thought much about the whole populations getting older. UN had the foresignt to convene a &amp;quot;world assembly on ageing&amp;quot; back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled &amp;quot;Averting the Old Age Crisis&amp;quot;, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.&lt;br /&gt;
	B)&amp;nbsp;For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, surrounded by the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.&lt;br /&gt;
	C) Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue reguar reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits, The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including the newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
	D) Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another quesion. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.&lt;br /&gt;
	E) The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the&amp;nbsp;opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time.&amp;nbsp;It may even keep them&amp;nbsp;alive longer. John Rother, the AARP&amp;#39;s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.&lt;br /&gt;
	F) Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may to because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour forece, increasing employers&amp;#39; choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.&lt;br /&gt;
	G)&amp;nbsp;In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;
	H) On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in the need of jobs, many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in&amp;nbsp;western&amp;nbsp;Europe&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;youthful&amp;nbsp;countries,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;three&amp;nbsp;times&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;ones.&amp;nbsp;Japan would&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;few&amp;nbsp;immigrants&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;present.&amp;nbsp;Public opinion polls&amp;nbsp;show&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;people&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;rich&amp;nbsp;countries already&amp;nbsp;think&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;immigration&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;too high. Further&amp;nbsp;big&amp;nbsp;increases&amp;nbsp;would&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;unfeasible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	I) To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.&lt;br /&gt;
	J)&amp;nbsp;And&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;fertility&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;does&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;pick&amp;nbsp;up?&amp;nbsp;It&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50-and older people turn out to vote in much greater numbers than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
	K)&amp;nbsp;Nor is&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;sign&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;intergenerational&amp;nbsp;warfare&amp;nbsp;predicted&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;1990s.&amp;nbsp;After&amp;nbsp;all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten&amp;nbsp;Hank&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Mannheim&amp;nbsp;University found&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;85%&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;lived&amp;nbsp;within&amp;nbsp;25km&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;each&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;majority&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;them were&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;touch&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;least&amp;nbsp;once&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	L)&amp;nbsp;Even&amp;nbsp;so,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shift&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;centre&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;gravity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;older&amp;nbsp;age&amp;nbsp;groups&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;bound&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;a profound&amp;nbsp;effect&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;societies, not&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;economically&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;politically&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;sorts of&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;ways&amp;nbsp;too. Richard Jackson and Neil&amp;nbsp;Howe&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;America&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;CSIS, in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;thoughtful book&amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Graying&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Great&amp;nbsp;Powers, argue&amp;nbsp;that, among&amp;nbsp;other&amp;nbsp;things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.&lt;br /&gt;
	M)&amp;nbsp;For&amp;nbsp;example,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;shortage&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;young&amp;nbsp;adults&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;likely&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;make&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world&amp;#39;s defence effort. Because America&amp;#39;s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically.&lt;br /&gt;
	N)&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;little&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;stop&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing,&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;to live&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;consequences&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;alleviated.&amp;nbsp;Many&amp;nbsp;experts&amp;nbsp;now believe that given the right policies, the&amp;nbsp;effects, though&amp;nbsp;grave, need&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;be catastrophic. Most&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;recognised&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;need&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;something&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;are beginning&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	O)&amp;nbsp;But&amp;nbsp;even&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;there&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;guarantee&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;efforts&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. The director of Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: &amp;quot;We&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t really&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;what&amp;nbsp;population&amp;nbsp;ageing&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;like,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;nobody&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;done&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;yet.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
