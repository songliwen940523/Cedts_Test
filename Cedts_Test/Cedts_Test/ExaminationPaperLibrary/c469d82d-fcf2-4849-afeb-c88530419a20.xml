        <Script>W: What can I show you, sir?
M: I had my travelling bag torn when climbing Mount Tai. I want to buy a new one.
W: What about this one? People like to call it \"everything bag\".
M: Why is it called \"everything bag\"?
W: The bag can be used for every purpose. It has six separate zipped compartments, and can hold a lot of things. It is made of artificial material that looks and feels like real leather.
M: Really? Will it scuff easily?
W: No, it won't. It does not soil easily either and most spots are easy to wipe out. What's more, when the bag isn't used, it can be folded up.
M: Great! It is practical and smart. I'll take it.</Script>

        <Script>Hi, I'm Roris Rily, and I'm the president of the college Environmental Awareness Club. Before we get started, I'd like to thank everyone for coming down to the lake today to help with the cleaning up project. As you probably know, we're going to be cleaning up all of the garbage here at the lake area. We'll begin by dividing into two ten-person teams. One team will pick up litter in the picnic area and jogging trail, and one will dig out garbage found in the shallow waters of the lake itself. We'll be putting the litter in these plastic trash bags. Toss any aluminum cans you find into these boxes, and we'll take them to the recycling center later. A local business has donated these "Do Not Litter" signs to the club. So we'll need a couple of people to place them around the lake when we are through. Ok, everyone who wants to clean up around picnic tables and along the jogging path, raise your hands.</Script>

        <Script>Why isn't a dollar worth as much as it used to be? One dollar is always worth the same amount, that is, 100 cents. But the value of a dollar is how much it can buy. The value of money depends on the cost of living. Economists say that the cost of living is the money that a family must pay for the necessities of life such as food, housing or rent, clothes, and medical expenses. For many years now, the cost of living has a low value, you can't buy as many things with it.
No one fully understands why the cost of living keeps increasing, but economists believe that workers and producers can make prices go up. As workers earn more money, they have more money to spend, so they demand more goods. If there is a great demand for certain goods, the prices also go up. For example, if everyone wants to buy more and more gas, the price of gas goes up.
Families need to know what happens to their money. They need to make their income meet the cost of living, so many people plan a family budget. A budget is a list of monthly expenses. Budgeting helps you spend your money wisely as the cost of living increases.</Script>

        <Script>There has been growing dissatisfaction about the quality of secondary education in state schools. Because of this, many parents have felt a need to educate their children privately, or even educate them at home.
The local education authority of a new town in the northeast of England, Compton, has decided to set up a committee composed of representatives of the following groups: the children who attend state secondary schools at the moment, their parents, and the teachers at these schools. The aim of the committee is to decide on the characteristics of a "model" school. The new secondary school which is due to open in Compton next year will be run in accordance with the guidelines drawn up by the committee.
Inevitably, there will be disagreement among members of the committee and some kind of compromise will have to be reached.</Script>

        <Content>        In the shoe family, Chinese-style embroidered（刺绣品） shoes, which have been deemed as a perfect combination of the shoe culture and the art of embroidery, are a 100-percent handicraft creation by Chinese people. (_1_) rooted in Chinese culture, they are (_2_) as "Chinese shoes". &lt;br/&gt;        In (_3_) China, ever since the matrilineal（母系的） society was (_4_) by a patriarchal（男性主宰的） one, the (_5_) division of labor has been (_6_) on men ploughing and women weaving; the tradition of (_7_) shoes has been passed down from one generation to another (_8_) Chinese women.&lt;br/&gt;        Aesthetic（审美的） (_9_), cultural traditions, ethics and morals, as (_10_) as the fashion of different dynasties, have all been well expressed by the needle and thread with which subtle and interesting changes have been incorporated.</Content>

        <Content>        Long hours at the screen can cause aching eyes, blurred vision and headaches, experts say. In fact, eyestrain surpasses even wrist pain as the top physical complaint among heavy computer users.&lt;br/&gt;        When peering into the computer screen, the eye's focusing muscle is at constant tension. Like any muscle, it feels sore when overloaded. And when someone spends a lot of time looking at something close, the eye muscle can get stuck on the near-focus setting and have difficulty relaxing, leaving the person temporarily nearsighted, a condition called accommodative spasm (痉挛) that can last seconds or hours.&lt;br/&gt;        This is why after looking at a monitor all day, some computer workers complain that their distance vision is blurred when they attempt to drive home.&lt;br/&gt;        The letters on the screen are not as clearly defined as on a printed page. Take a magnifying glass to your monitor and you'll see the letters, each made up of pinpoint sources of light, have no sharp edges. But those liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, like those found on laptop computers, are easier on the eyes because they display sharper images.&lt;br/&gt;        And studies have shown that when people are working on a computer, their rate of blinking goes down by two-thirds, which can result in dry, stinging eyes. This is especially a problem for contact-lens wearers.</Content>

        <Content>        The next time someone receives an award as an outstanding teacher, take a close look at the reasons given for selecting that particular person. Seldom is it because his or her students did higher quality work in math or spoke better English or in fact had any accomplishments that were better than those of other students of teachers who did not get an award. &lt;br/&gt;        If your criterion for judging teachers is how much their students learn, then you can end up with a wholly different list of who are the best teachers. Some of the most unimpressive-looking teachers have consistently turned out students who know their subject far better than teachers who cut a more dashing figure in the classroom and receive more lavish praise from their students or attention from the media. &lt;br/&gt;        My own experience as an undergraduate student at Harvard was completely consistent with what I later learned as a teacher. One of my teachers — Professor Arthur Smithies — was a highly respected scholar but was widely regarded as a terrible teacher. Yet what he taught me has stayed with me for more than 40 years. Nobody observing Professor Smithies in class was likely to be impressed by his performance. He sort of drifted into the room, almost as if he had arrived there by accident. During talks, he often paused to look out the window and seemingly became fascinated by the traffic in Harvard Square. &lt;br/&gt;        But Smithies did teach us. He got us to think — often by questioning us in a way that forced us to follow out the logic of what we were saying to its ultimate conclusion. Often some policy that sounded wonderful, if you looked only at the immediate results, would turn out to be counterproductive if you followed your own logic beyond stage one. Arthur Smithies would never get a teaching award by the standards of the education establishment today.</Content>
