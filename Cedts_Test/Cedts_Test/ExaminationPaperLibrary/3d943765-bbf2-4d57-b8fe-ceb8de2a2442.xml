        <Content>&lt;b&gt;Ready for anything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;        Justin was always prepared. His motto was "Never throw anything out; you never know when it might come in handy." His bedroom was so full of flat bicycle tires, bent tennis rackets, deflated （瘪掉的） basketballs, and games with missing pieces that you could barely get in the door. His parents pleaded with him to clean out his room.&lt;br/&gt;        "What use is a fish tank with a hole in the bottom?" his father asked. But Justin simply smiled and repeated his motto, "Never throw anything out, you never know when it might come in handy."&lt;br/&gt;        When Justin was away from home, he always carried his blue backpack. He liked to think of it as a smaller version of his bedroom — a place to store the many objects that he collected. It was so worn and stretched that it hardly resembled a backpack anymore. It was full of the kind of things that seemed unimportant, but when used with a little imagination, might come in handy.&lt;br/&gt;        Justin had earned a reputation for figuring things out and getting people out of otherwise hopeless situations. Many of his classmates and neighbors sought him out when they needed help with a problem. On the first day of school, his friend Kenny came looking for Justin.&lt;br/&gt;        "Do you think you have something in your bag that could help me remember my locker combination （转字锁密码）?" he asked. "I lost the scrap of paper it was written on. I have science class in two minutes and if I'm late on the first day it'll make me look bad for the rest of the year." Kenny looked genuinely worried.&lt;br/&gt;        "Relax," Justin said, taking his backpack off and unzipping the top. "Remember how you borrowed my notebook in homeroom to write the combination down? Well, I know how we can recover what you wrote."&lt;br/&gt;        He took the notebook and a soft lead pencil out of his bag. The page that Kenny had written on had left faint indentations （凹痕） on another page in the notebook. Justin held the pencil on its side and rubbed it lightly over the indentations. Slowly but surely the numbers of the locker combination appeared in white, set off by the gray pencil rubbings.&lt;br/&gt;        "That's amazing!" Kenny said. "I owe you one." And he dashed off to open his locker. &lt;br/&gt;        After school, Justin rode the bus to the mall where he worked at a music store. His boss, Gail, was taking inventory of all of the CDs and tapes in the classical music section. As he helped a customer at the register, Justin heard her exclaim, "Oh, no! I forgot my glasses! There's no way I can read this list without them." Justin sighed, picked up his backpack, and walked over to Gail.&lt;br/&gt;        "I think I can help you out," he said, unzipping the bag. While Gail watched in surprise, he pulled out a jar of petroleum jelly, a washer, a glass slide, and a small bottle of water. He put the jelly on the bottom of the washer, placed it securely, jelly-side down, on the glass slide, and then put a drop of water in the center of the washer.&lt;br/&gt;        He put the contraption （精巧的装置） on top of the inventory list and said to his boss, "See what happens when you look through the water droplet." Gail looked and her eyes widened with delight.&lt;br/&gt;        "Wow!" she cried. "It enlarges the print that I'm looking at, just like a magnifying glass!" She patted Justin on the back. "I'm all set now," she said. "Thanks."&lt;br/&gt;        Justin smiled. "No problem," he said, returning to the register.&lt;br/&gt;        It was just another day in the life of the boy whose motto was "Never throw anything out; you never know when it might come in handy."</Content>
